If the three holidays were before the starting of your leave then you are entitled to get the salary. If those three holidays were at the end of your holidays then you are not entitled. In the second case you should have joined at least the day before the Eid holidays. In your case you are not entitled as the Eid holidays were in the middle of your leave.	0

I thought it was open.	there are a couple of restaurants that are opening within the next few months; i think. i visited with a friend of mine and we saw a nice Indian Restaurant and an Egyptian traditional restaurant. i dont know if they are fully open but we saw some people inside. we also saw some other restaurants right in front of the beach area. one was looking like a nice lounge with great interiors! (we saw only from the outside of course!) and the bigger restaurant looks like they will have a show kitchen (with glass windows to see the kitchen). the place is huge with a nice view of the pristine beach. they have cleaners everywhere to keep the place tidy. i cant wait for it to open to the public. im sure it will be one of the nicest spots in Doha.	0

What happened here? Seems to me some of us were having a sensible discussion about prostitution in Qatar and the thread vanished??? Am I missing something? Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?	I did not see anything deserving of sensoring/editing unless we look at the original post; and I am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread 'alive'.	It's not that China; it was deleted because the thread was trolling and promoting prostitution; such threads that promote something whether it was prostitution or otherwise gets deleted.

So let's talk about it here! :-) I'm surprised that prostitution is that open in what is considered a conservative country; I mean if it's so obvious that these women are prostituting them; then I'm sure authorities know about it...the question is...why aren't they doing anything about it ?	0

I did not see anything deserving of sensoring/editing unless we look at the original post; and I am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread 'alive'.	OK; thats understandable; thank you. It also underlines mir83 and my point that we believed prostitution is less tolerable here in Qatar. However; the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives; until something is said by somebody; and then the routine mass deportations take place. It goes quiet for a while; and then the 'night girls' start building up in numbers again to the level they are now. My last sentence; before the previous thread was deleted was something like this; 'mark my words; the ladies will vanish any day now. Over the few weeks after that; their numbers will slowly increase again; and the cycle repeats it's self'. Obviously somebody is behind this (a pimp); as a sponsor for these girls.	0

Cornellian; somebody answered this on the previous thread just before it was deleted. I cannot recall the poster; but it was suggested that some body in authority; possible with some 'wasta' to throw around; was probably behind it. My apologies if I have not recalled what was said precisely; but I would go along with that theory anyway. There are just far too many girls; far too often; in so many places for it to be anything else. Unless somebody knows differently ofcourse ................?	0

But if that "pimp" is powerful enough to keep the authorities quiet; then he must be powerful enough to keep the religious fraternity too. I think no matter what anyone says or does; prostitution will always exist everywhere; because there will always be women who need the money and men who are ready to pay.	0

First get the Application Form for Profession Change; get your sponser sign & seal on that paper then goto Labour Dept(near to American Hosp) along with; 1) Sponser ID copy 2) Munciplaity Bill 3) Edu.

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	0

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

Do not fall for the negativity on the forum. If you don't like it and can't cope with the social life; you always have the option of resigning.

LCD or Plasma TV? I beleive plasma is better for cable and sat tv? Qr3979 Good buy?	There is a good samsound 42inch plasma in carrefour; lulu and virigin. series 4 42A410 i think it is.	If you're in the market for a big screen television like 50 50-inches and above -- then i'd suggest plasma as a safe bet. Plasmas give you more bang for your buck at the big end of town; and while LCDs can give you better resolution; plasma still has the edge in terms of picture quality. One other thing to look for; whether you opt for plasma or LCD; is an integrated tuner -- many TVs still have analogue tuners; which look pretty terrible on a large screen. Try to get a model with an inbuilt HD tuner if you can. At the smaller end of things (15" to 42" TVs); LCD is the only way to go if you want something slim and tasteful.	1

LCD hands down. In almost everyway; lcd wins; it is superior. if movies look bad on satellite; it the decoders fault. You might also look into NOT USING COMPOSITE CABLES as they make it useless to own a HD tv. use vga; dvi or hdmi. Using a component cable for a hd tv; is worse than buying a ferarri; without any gas. yes its that pointless.	1

Buy Philips; Sony; Hitachi; Panasonic but DO NOT BUY SAMSUNG. Samsung TVs will not support you for more than 1 and half 2 years.

During my short visit I got the impression that Muslim or not; it's each individual's decision (or sometimes her family's or community's decision) and if no veil is chosen (whether for the hair alone/hijab or hair and face/burka/niqab) that modest dress is ok.	1

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	1

I am married with no kids and considering a reasonable life style.	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0

I really want to know what is this Arabic fascination in almost all the British Curriculum schools in Doha? so what is the solution?	It is not compulsory in Indian schools.

I really want to know what is this Arabic fascination in almost all the British Curriculum schools in Doha? so what is the solution?	It is not compulsory in Indian schools. So what is the solution for non-arabics who want their children to get educated in British schools. i know there are a few British schools where Arabic is not compulsory but getting admission in them is really difficult.	i don't believe all schools are forcing this; best to search around. friend has a son in grade 6; doesn't have to take.	0

While love is essential for a long lasting marriage; the idea of "true love" ie: the crap you read in romance novels and see on movies; is a fallicy and a dangerous one at that.

I know its a new school; but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow American or British curriculum?

Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types. Remember; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers.

Now if we are to discuss the meaning of this word vaccinate then what is being done is not vaccination as by definition a vaccination is to inoculate with a vaccine to produce immunity. It is proven that this is not being done. How is it that 20% of TB cases in Qatar had been 'vaccinated' and received boosters?

What do y'all think ? ?	So me and a friend were just discussing this. And we have conflicting ideas. I think that if a man really loves and respects his wife; then he will not wander off to an another's lady's arms when his wife is or isn't around. My friend; on the other hand; thinks that no matter what men will eventually wander and be seduced by other women.	Monogamy is a very odd thing; very few animals practice true monogamny (mainly birds). I think men wander because it's in there genes to spread their bloodline as far as possible; and they will chase a fertile female; it's a dreadful habit.	1

I think that if a man really loves and respects his wife; then he will not wander off to an another's lady's arms when his wife is or isn't around. My friend; on the other hand; thinks that no matter what men will eventually wander and be seduced by other women.	i think ur friend is right.....men are easily seduced not matter what; sometimes its a mistake they realise too late but eventually it will happen if the woman is persistant.

My friend; on the other hand; thinks that no matter what men will eventually wander and be seduced by other women.	Temptation is one thing; actually going ahead with the affair is another. Everyone gets tempted...but that's where our self-control comes into play. Are men (or women for that matter) that weak that they would give in to temptation that easily and throw out all the hard work they put into a relationship ? So if ur saying that men do inevitably stray; then why commit in the first place ? I'm not always right; but I'm never wrong :P - Garfield	0

Well AJ; this supports what u said: "Monogamy is so rare in the animal world that only 3-5 % of the mammals are known to form lifelong pair bonds; like beavers; otters; jackals; foxes; some bats and a few dwarf deer and antelopes. In fact; strict monogamy is almost inexistent; as creatures that do pair for life; occasionally have flings on the side and some; like the wolf; do not mourn too much a death or a no longer sexually performing partner." http://news.softpedia.com/news/Monogamy-is-an-Oddity-42006.shtml But we aren't like other animals; we don't function solely on sexual or biological desires. If that was the case; then what's marriage for ? I'm not always right; but I'm never wrong :P - Garfield	1

I'm simply examining the phenomena of monogamy and whether it exists in humans or not. Yes there are alot of factors that come into play; but we can't blame it on external stimuli; we are capable of inner control. Using those external factors as excuses is an easy way of getting away with it. I'm not always right; but I'm never wrong :P - Garfield	0

Exactly smoke; thinking of the next set of boobs is different than going ahead and grabbing them. That's what I'm saying; temptation is different than actually going for it.

Had just bought a bottle of champagne ready to see in the New Year when the police arrived. He had to leave it there so was a bit pissed off!! The DJ was telling people to leave; that it was not a joke. Maybe your friend was drinking at one of the houses/apartments on Garvey's compound?	1

But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year. Here's where some extra expenses might figure into the mix... So; not bad; but that salary is rather low for a PhD.	1

Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	You should plan it very well so that you don't waste any of your time there. Search in the internet what places in Paris would be very interesting for you. I suggest;t he best place to view Eiffel Tower is in Tocadero. Try to find; a map that will guide you on how to use the Metro system in France. If you have plan of going to Disneyland; one day isn't enough if you have kids. I hope this is useful enough and enjoy!	1

Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	Make sure you visit the catacombs; which are underground tunnels stuffed with human bombs. Creepy; but very interesting. Notre Dame is interesting; but Sacre Couer is my favorite by far. If you're not really into art then the Lourve can prove to be an expensive waste of time. It's HUGE; and it can take you hours to find the stuff you really want to see. The Musee D'Orsay is a much smaller gallery with a much more focussed collection of impressionist masterpieces. Get to know the Metro system; it is an amazing way to get around. The Palais Garnier is an underrated attraction. Hopefully you can visit on a day that is operating tours. I really enjoy the restaurants in the Marais area; if you're looking for some place to eat.	1
Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	My husband & I went there for 2 days by train from Switzerland (part from our honeymoon). and I found out 2 days were enough and won't go there again. We've stayed at Hotel Plaza Athenee; which has a view of the Eiffel Tower. It was lovely & it is the same hotel that Sarah Jessica Parker stayed in in one of "Sex & the city" episodes. Of course going on top of Eiffel Tower is great. and we went there early in the morning to avoid the long lines. also: * Louvre * Arc de Triomphe * Versai Palace * Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris * old down town Paris * If you have kids 1 day in Disneyland; otherwise I don't recommend it. * A walk in the Champs-Elysees street. which has number of cafe's & restaurants. make sure to stand in the middle of the street & take picture of the Arc de Triomphe I always do a research on Yahoo travels. there are lots of useful reviews and recommendations for hotels; things to do & restaurants.

Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	having been to Paris twice now. 1. Buy a guide book--they have several at Jarir or Virgin. 2. Agree with above poster: A. Sacre Coeur better than Notre Dame. I also like Saint Chapelle better; which is only about a block from Notre Dame. B. Metro is fabulous C. Lourve is huge; just run to your favorites and skip the rest. D. I enjoyed Versailles; especially the grounds. E. Eiffel Tower lines can be long or short depending on day and time. If super long; then leave and come back later. F. Walk around in the Jardin des Tuileries.	1

His name is Mathieu Bertrand; and for me; he's one of the friendliest Parisians in town. If you have spare time; party hard at the Queen. Le gay Parie! ;)	1

Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	Buy tickets for the hop-on/hop-off open top buses -you can get on and off as much as you want and there are 4 different tour routes so you can see almost all of the best sites for a reasonable price.I can recommend the Royal Magda Hotel near the Arc de Triomphe- small but spotlessly clean. Climb to the top of the Arc de Triomphe for a fantastic view of the Champs Elysses and Paris-it's better than the view from the Eiffel Tower. Beware of pickpockets and scam artists particularly in the Sacre Coeur area. Keep your wallet under your shirt next to your body.Have a great trip. > May your dreams take you travelling all through your life.	1
Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	When arriving in Paris you can take the Air France shuttle bus into Paris from the airport and it will drop off at the Arc de Triomphe where you can get ataxi to your accomodation.Its cheaper and safer than taking a taxi or the metro.> May your dreams take you travelling all through your life.	1
Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	If you do take the Metro from CDG; have some coins with you because the ticket vending machines don't accept notes; and the queue to the ticket counter can be very long.	0
Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	I recommend you visit Louvre Museum to see what Napoleon has stolen from Egypt..very interesting stuff though... For food; try Noura restaurant for fine Arabic food..two branches; one in Chapms Elysee and the the other one off the Opera station... La Defense is another nice place for walking and wondering about.. Try also the latin square and the Arabic cultural centre which has interesting history remarks..it is also close the the Bastil... Eiffel Tower is nice but don't climb it if you have heights phobia..surroundings is enough beauty.. Don't go to Pigale area at night..it becomes unstable.. I am sure you heard of De Triumph Arch so don't miss it..you can get up to its top..nice for fotos.. Have a safe journey..	1

Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	Few more tips; if you still haven't traveled yet. For Music visit: Palais Garnier. For Shopping and reasonably priced souvenirs visit: Lafayette and Rue de la Huchette (this oldest street has lots of yummy shawerma) CuriousButDetermined on the Louvre: "see what Napoleon has stolen from Egypt"; the same applies to the British Museum; it contains the largest Egyptian antiquities collection; confiscated by the British army back in the days.

Any tips? Good places to visit? Restaurants?	My visa to Paris is approved!	Paris Favorites: Eating; Drinking and Shoopping.no ;sure not that all limited when the place is Paris.do not by pass visiting Muse de la Mode (10; avenue Pierre Ier de Serbie)The museum is a treasure trove of fashions from the 18th - 20th centuries; it would be a great off the beaten path stop for a trip to Paris and some other tips for you; Tip #1 for Paris - If you are in Paris driving a car; be aware that people in Paris drive however they want to. Tip #2 - If you have a car; get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park. Tip #3 - Learn a bit of French. A great book which has a lot of basic phrases and fun things to try is Rick Steves' handy pocketbook guide to basic French (find book) Tip #4 - Use the Metro (the subway). There is simply no better way to get around Paris. But make sure you've brushed up on your French. It will help with buying tickets and understanding the maps in the subways. Tip #5 - The lines and crowds at the Eiffel Tower can get very long. If you must see the lights of Paris at night (and you should) Go on a week night (not Friday); or make reservations. TIP #6 - The Louvre. From what I understand; if you are an art lover and really appreciate art museums; you could spend weeks there; but for most people; half a day is enough time. You see the famous pictures (Mona Lisa); and spend some time looking at the amazing art. if you go on Sunday morning and get there as they're opening; it's free admission. TIP # 7 - If there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in Paris; it's in the roundabout that goes around the Arc D'Triomphe. If you rent a car and drive here; just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules. TIP #8 - There are lots of wonderful museums in France! One of them is the Pantheon; which was originally a church; and originally planned to be something other than that .Victor Hugo and some other famous French people are buried there. Make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that's something you want to do. TIP #9 - Have some small change (or large change if you can afford it) on hand for the street performers. They're pretty good! TIP #10 - If you like looking at the inside of churches; take some time for Notre' Dame; and if you have a problem with crowds; don't go on the weekend. People were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays; but there are a lot of people there on the weekends; so you end up waiting in line; and it gets more noisy inside. TIP #11 - If you want to see the Eiffel Tower light up and sparkle at night; get there right before the hour. TIP #12 - If you see a person on the street who is selling something and wants to sketch you or give you something for free; don't be fooled by talk which says they'll so something for free. IT ISN'T FREE! __________________________________________ <b>Attitudes are more important than facts...</b>	1

Dubai's credibility of keeping the workers on their jobs and not looking into exodus are more overwhelming to me. I was more excited when they showcase Palm Jumeirah's opening but after the spectacular events; the country's market went into a limbo; more job lay-offs. I don't want to sound negative but I got a feeling the event shows only another bad facade (hope not). I don't know but reading the news such as this one makes me skeptical.	0

First get the Application Form for Profession Change; get your sponser sign & seal on that paper then goto Labour Dept(near to American Hosp) along with; 1) Sponser ID copy 2) Munciplaity Bill 3) Edu.

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	0

What do you recommend as a French speaking school? Voltaire or Bonaparte?	Hey; Considering a move to Qatar.	Both are good schools but Bonaparte will teach your kids to become a good leader but they concentrate mainly on outdoor physical activities; manoeuvers & strategies. Horse riding and lances & swords are their speciality. They also concentrate on proper health hygiene & sanitation and frequently remind the kid about properly using water in the loo..which the gauls generally dislike! So they will make a good manager & strategist of you kid! on the other hand Voltaire will make your child more of a philosopher! They encourage independent thinking...and mainly concentrates on indoor activities! They inculcate good moral values in the child and he will surely grow up to be a thinking person! In school they encourage kids to read great works of science and fiction. The literary skills in your kid will bloom. In addition they also teach the art of candid photography & journalism! Specialization: Wit & sattire in poetry & Prose!	1

What do you recommend as a French speaking school? Voltaire or Bonaparte?	Hey; Considering a move to Qatar.	Bonaparte is probably much more famous than Voltaire. Apart from "Candide"; no one bothers with Voltaire's literary works any more. Yes; he was a leading force in the Enlightenment and he has had some influence on French thought; but Napoleon's influence upon the whole of Europe was far more profound. I suppose that you could compare Napoleon to Hitler; as in some ways Napoleon was responsible for a series of wars that affected the whole of Europe; from the gates of Moscow to Madrid. On the other hand; Napoleon was not a racist and certainly never even contemplated genocide. To be fair to Napoleon; it is true to say that the old monarchies of Europe were very unhappy with the appearance of republican France and therefore they set out to squash the Revolution by force of arms. So Napoleon did not start the wars that dragged on until 1815; but he certainly continued them; very successfuly for a long while; and his final defeat also meant the end of the Revolution and the return of the Bourbons.	1

What do you recommend as a French speaking school? Voltaire or Bonaparte?

You should check the school's curriculum; activities plan and the academic calendar...ask for the strength of the particular class and see the premises... If youre satisfied by all means; then decide yourself where to enroll your child.	1

The best thing to kill bed bugs is actually FREE - UV light! take your mattress outside for a few hours. don't forget to turn it regularly.	1

But my suspect was this other room which is I think a factory of bed bugs. I want to eliminate these creatures before any serious infections happen.	They are the worst creatures/bugs on planet earth. Its so difficult to exterminate them. What ever pesticide you will use most probably they will show up again. What ever the pesticide. The only thing I believe can work is that take all your wooden furniture out in hot sunny day including your bed and leave it there for couple of hours. Killing them by burning them is the only good solution. Pesticide can work but you will never get 100% results. I once saw a documentary on national geographic and I am telling you its really hard to get rid of them. If you think they are coming from the next room then my recommendation to move out. If I have to pay 10K for one room I will instead living in a room which is free but full of bugs. Good Luck exterminating bugs. Peace.	1

But my suspect was this other room which is I think a factory of bed bugs. I want to eliminate these creatures before any serious infections happen.	Hi friends; Those nasty bed bugs are not only living on the bed. They live on the curtains; furnitures and even under carpet. If you leave them untouched for some time they will increase in number. UV light is good for killing them from your bed but you cannot take everything to sun light. It will be better if you treat all the materials in your room at the same time. Take your bed to the balcony or terrace and leave it there for two three days in the hot sun light turning it upside down very often. You may use the pesticide (the one from Carrefour) in your room for one or two days. Spray well and keep the room closed. You should use it vigorously. This will kill the bed bugs in your room as well as on your bed. Make sure that your friends in the other room should also do it at the same time otherwise you will not be able to clear them.	1

Ziplock bags; chocolate chips and pie pans you can get here in almost all the shops (definitely Shoprite & Megamart). Canned pumpkin - sorry don't eat it but they seem to sell every other kind of canned product here! Cookbooks and books - Loads of places to buy books here so don't worry. A lot of people organise book swaps and the best place to buy them are all the table top sales! Diet root beer - can't help you on that one but Shoprite seem to sell a lot of american brand drinks but they are quite pricey. I would be really careful bringing them over though in case they leak etc. www.qaws.org	1

Canned pumpkin is sometimes available at MegaMart; but if you want some for this Thanksgiving then I would bring it with you just to be sure. I did bring a HEAP of ziplocs with me from the U.S. They're pricey here and I have only found the good freezer bags at MegaMart for $$$. Seriously; I went to Costco and purchased a couple of packs of the Gallon and a couple of the quart. Haven't regretted it yet. . .BUT. . .I also had a 40' container and almost no furniture so it was a no-brainer for me. You can get chocolate chips here; but in the event that you're a chocolate connoisseur don't count on the good stuff. The waxy-tasting Nestle is about as good as you'll get for chocolate chips.	1

Best place for baking stuff (including chocolate chips) is Shoprite - they have Hersheys choc chips :D... One for me... One for the cookie dough...

Fresh? I find very little of our produce to fall under the category of what I would call "fresh" ;) Yes; bring some canned pumpkin just in case MegaMart runs out. You can find regular ol' ziplocs or generic ziploc-types .. .but the freezer bags that really hold up are not readily available unless you pay $$ at MegaMart. (That said; I haven't tried Shoprite.)	0

Just don't wait until the last minute and you'll be fine. I still have 3 cans from last year in fact. I can buy freezer bags practically anywhere. Decent choc chips come and go. Just stock up when they are here and put them in your freezer. I do buy cookbooks in the US each summer; only have found British ones here (besides the US current best sellers--which are expensive!) Diet root beer can also be found--sometimes. I tried to find a pie pan all last year and know they NEVER had a proper one at the grocery stores. I bought a new pie pan in the US this summer. My advice: don't bring food. My employer didn't allow it anyway; and most don't.	0

At the end of the day you get use to stocking up on what you like when you find it here; and if you can't then learn to substitute or do without. I stopped bringing food back years ago. Our bed mattress was the best thing we brought over. Can't find the quality here.	0

My salary is only Qr. 5;000 and my wife is only Qr. 3;500. 2. We are both under different company sponsoship.	Although babies born to expatriate parents are not entitled to Qatari citizenship; the birth still needs to be registered in Qatar; and a Qatari birth certificate issued (as well as a birth certificate from the parents' home country). The process for obtaining a Qatari birth certificate was simplified in 2010. All births should be registered at the Women's Hospital (next to Hamad General Hospital on Al Rayyan Road); regardless of which hospital the baby was delivered in. The hospital where the delivery took place should issue two letters to the parents confirming the birth. These should then be taken to the Women's Hospital; along with the following documents: A copy of the child's vaccination card The passports of both parents Copies of the parents' Residence Permits The parents' marriage certificate There is some paperwork to fill out; and a fee per certificate is payable. The birth certificate is issued at the Women's Hospital on the same day. It is issued in Arabic; and needs to be.....	1

My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?	I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.	1

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Drive through Saudi is NOT dangerous. The road is absolutely normal; just keep away from trucks. The only problem is total lack of gas stations. However as it has been told here - it is not fun; and the only reason to do so is probably shopping in IKEA.	0

You save on air fare (specially if there are more than one persons travelling) and then on taxis in UAE. Do what u think is best but it is not dangerous inside saudi. It is just a normal highway.	0

For a skilled worker from philippines - the normal basic salary is ranging from QR 2;500 to 5;000 excluding housing and transpo allowances. For professionals - salary is ranging from QR 8;000 to 45;000 depending on the qualification and industry. I know some colleagues in oil & gas; banking industry and investments are even receiving between QR 50k to 80k per month. So it all depends on your qualification and work experiences. Good luck!	0

Frankly speaking the salary offered to you is a meager one if Doha standard of living is concerned. For your food alone you have to shell out at least 800 riyals per month. Your personal needs is an additional cost of 200 riyals. So total you'll have a net salary of 2000 riyals or about 500 dlrs. Socializing is another strain in your pocket. But it's okay as long as you follow the good manners and right conduct of being a foreigner here. No public display of affection and you must dress up modestly. If you think 2000 riyals is enough savings for you then good luck and welcome to Doha.	1

I have heard they will capture neuter and release; if you can get ahold of them.	Honestly - don't bother calling as they will never answer! Forget fax and email as well! You have to go down in person to the Animal Resource Department on Airport Road and talk to someone there. They're open between 6.30am and 1.30pm Sunday - Thursday. If it's one or two cats they will lend you traps that you can set; trap the cats and take in before 10am for neutering. They can be collected the following morning and you can re-release them into your area If it's a large population then they will probably arange to come and trap them themselves and release them.	1

Chelsea Thank you for that info - we also have a major cat problem on our compound and I need to get hold of them but I work (and they really won't give me time off to go to the Animal welfare place). You don't happen to know if they are open a little later in the day? Many thanks J	1

For a 4 Yr old child and on ward: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.	1.In all honesty I am not totally satisfied with the schools here; but since both my husband and I wish that our daughter should become fluent in Arabic; we have her in an Arabic Independent or "musthakhilla" school. 2There are deffo plenty of cons but since she is now rapidly improving in her Arabic; and doing good nuff in her subjects I will prefer to keep my complaints between the school staff and us. Suffice to say I guess that no school can ever be perfect! 3.Around 12;000QR 4.Arabic and English only 5.Well I'd say it's always best to build up a good relationship with the school's administration and always address them promptly when faced with any questions and concerns. This is crucial.	1

Seriously; if SA wants to know what IS now; then this is it: 1. No school can be recommended 2. Therefore this question becomes obsolete 3. Current fees are between QAR 12.000 to QAR 70.000 per year 4.English and another language of choice (Arabic; French; Spanish; etc.) 5. Administration should involve parents much more. Currently there is just a drop-off and pick-up service the parents are involved in. All together: the school system in Qatar is Stone-Age and a SHAME for the so-called 'Richest Country in the world'!	1

Furthermore; subject teachers should have AT LEAST a Masters Degree in their subject and should be continuously be trained! That should; however; go hand-in-hand with an annual increase of salaries.

I have been here 9 years now. for 9 years my children have attended a school where there are over 67 different nationalities. There are muslims; Christians; buddhists; hindus and even jews there. They all exist in peace and mutual respect. What school?-The American School of Doha and NO ONE has ever tried to indoctrinate my children into anything. All they have done is provide them with an excellent educational and a taught them global citizenship. Don't talk of what you don't know please. Our family values are still very much in tact.	1

Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	1
Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be "unskilled" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold.	1
Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	light of the subject but think it is a valid point that gumby made; if there are people willing to do the job; myself included but the positions are empty being reserved for Qatari's it seems so pointless :( please excuse me I am at the moment mesmerised by the above signature!!!! lol	0

Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	the "pecking" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment. If the jobs have been vacant for so long; do you actually need the jobs?	0

A professor at the University of Tottenham was giving a lecture on Paranormal Studies.. To get a feel for his audience; he asks: "How many people here believe in ghosts?" About 90 students raise their hands. "Well; thats a good start. Out of those who believe in ghosts; do any of you think you have seen a ghost?" About 40 students raise their hands.. "Thats really good. I'm really glad you take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost?" About 15 students raise their hands.. "Has anyone here ever touched a ghost?" 3 students raise their hands... "Thats fantastic. Now let me ask you one question further... Have any of you ever made love to a ghost?" Way in the back; MarcoNandoz-01 raises his hand. The professor takes off his glasses and says: "Son all the years I've beee giving this lecture; no one has ever claimed to have made love to a ghost. You've got to come up here and tell us about your experience." Middle Eastern MarcoNandoz-01 replied with a nod and a grin; and began to make his way up to the podium. When he reached the front of the room; the professor asks: "So MarcoNandoz-01; tell us what its like to have sex with a ghost?" MarcoNandoz-01 replied: "Oh Shyte; from way back there; i thought you said Goats"	0

They are very helpful to us. lol I have never experienced these spirits myself but specific family members have repeatedly spoken about their encounters. 1. Grandmother was about to be hit by a bus. And 'somebody' picked her up and moved her out of the way. Turned around to say thanks but mysteriously no one was there. 2. Grandmother again when she was a child was in her room when a fire started. Freaked out as she was a strange spirit (what she thought was an angel) came down and told her' "Don't be afraid." And she calmed down and she sat down not being afraid. Until her father came breaking down the door screaming like "What the hell is the matter with you!!!" But she just said; "I am not afraid." :D 3. Great Grandmother was about to touch a high voltage wire until she sees this 'angel' spirit sitting right in front of it! 4. My Aunt is a little different hers are more like freaky strange spirits not as helpful as the others. :D Her's are more disturbing the peace by shutting and slamming doors randomly around the house. And many more of other stories of such experiences. Some are indeed friendly ghosts though! :D	1

It would be a lifetime experience...either way. During our college days; a junior female student committed suicide in a lake which was inside our college campus. For many months after the incident some of us tried to go there late nights if her ghost would tell us the real story!! Well; we were not matured then and we seriously thought we could solve this case talking to her ghost. Now I laugh at myself for being so stupid.	1

Also I would like to mention one point here that for online money transfer; Dohabank exchange rates are always better than commercial bank; so for me I have also opened a Dohabank saving account which I use for online money transfer to ICICI NRE account & This transfer is also fast; most of the time one working day.	1

I see kids reading different kinds of books these days. I can't say whether these books are better or worse as I haven't read them...but these new books just don't appeal to my eyes. But I think the books that you read as a child makes a permanent impression in your mind...and when we see today's kids reading other books...we feel they are missing our books.	0

Does anyone know if there have been any official announcements about house rents in Doha? Does anyone know if the rents will go higher in 2013?	Several months ago it was predicted that the rent will come down; but it seems that its going up; instead.	What do you mean official? Any reports are only guesswork. Yes; some landlords are putting their rents up because there's a demand on certain properties in the market. Anything that's popular and decent quality will probably see a year on year raise...if you don't like it; they just rent to the next person. On average though; there really shouldn't be a raise!	1

" Nearly two-third of Qatar's population consists of males; reflecting a very low female sex ratio overall. Like other Gulf countries this fact can be attributed to the presence of higher number of expatriate male workers' population living as singles. The female sex ratio on the contrary is low to very low in old Doha area and in the out side urban areas. Exceptionally; the industrial area of Zone 57 has just 3 females per 1000 of males.

What is considered a good package in Qatar? Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport.	The only way to determine if it's a decent package is to try and assess your living costs and determine how much you would be able to save. That's what the majority of people are in Qatar for....to save. It's difficult to fix on a salary as there are so many extras (as others have mentioned) such as education allowance for kids; housing; transport; possibly a furnishing grant etc.	1
What is considered a good package in Qatar? Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport.	Prada; Package is fine in itself; it combines all major costs; hence you will be able to set aside little. But you will not be living like a king. If your salary back home is equal; stay away. If this is a major improvement ... why not.	1
What is considered a good package in Qatar? Is this good; bad ..... or just okay?	I was approaced by a company; they offer 1800USD + housing + relocation + schooling + transport.	Thanks for the replies .... now we're getting somewhere hehe. We're a family of three. They will also cover schooling; which is great; since we have a 2 yr old. I think it's okay; since they will cover all major costs. At the moment; we're looking at saving about 2000QAR. DH will also have to find a job once we are there. I have requested a detailed breakdown of all the extra's they will be covering; so I'm waiting to hear back from them. If they cover all major expenses (housing; schooling; transport; relocation; medical) ... 6400QAR + DH's salary are not to bad (I think).	0

Cost is not the issue; the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is.I really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her.	Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...	1
Has anyone done this? Can anyone help.	KLM have told me my Yorkshire Terrier is able to travel in the cabin with me from the U.K to Doha. 2 pet relocation companies have told me I cant and Im unsure whether they are telling me this to avoid getting their fee or whether I have been misinformed by KLM. Cost is not the issue; the wellbeing of our wonderful pet is.I really want the most stress free method of travel possible for her.	Thank you so much for this information Tiddsmum. Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold. I will also contact Doha Vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival.	0

It was my impression that only Lufthansa and maybe KLM did this. Mandi	0

Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&num=20&form=search&gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this. Hope it all goes well for you and your daughter's dog. Have to say though; August is an awfully brutal month to be bringing the poor thing out there; hope it doesn't have a full coat!	0

Time to put your YT on a diet????? The airline website will give you the maximum dimensions of the carrier (but do not be put off by the height restriction; as these special carriers squash down to the maximum allowed height ~20 cm I think)	1

Yorkies average in at 2-3 kg; my cat is 4 kg and these carriers are designed to be super light; for this exact purpose! Bar chiuauas; I cannot think of a lighter dog. It's worth pursing anyway and DohaVets and the airlines are experts on this; so don't be disheartened. You don't get anywhere without trying....	1

I'm on a roll now - if you check the link I posted; the type of carrier you will need weighs in at 900g...to go over the recommended weight allowance; that would have to be one hell of an obese Yorkie !!! ;-)	0

He has the right to ask you to convert and you have the right to accept or no. If a christian woman fall in love with a muslim man then they can marry and the Muslim man should not force her.

Converting BECAUSE YOU'RE IN LOVE with the SOMEONE is NOT REALLY a valid point. It is your belief and faith that should be the major factor why you want to convert. Ok; let's say you converted to your BF's religion: what if in the long run; you guys broke up? You mean; you will go back to your former religion? What is BF doing to prove his love for you?

Reflect on what marriage means and give a thought to your future if you do not convert and have children. This seems to be the biggest problem in these relationships. You may both be secure in your individual faiths; but your children may suffer. Sorry to bring in a down point ; just want to be a sincere advisor to you.	1

Does religion really matters to you then why at the first place enter into a relationship! It is your personal call....mutually agree or compromise decide before marriage.	1

I think you should convert to muslim or he should left the Muslim religion and convert to Christian. its better to have the same religion with your partner in this way you will have the same faith.	1

Before how many days I can do it?	Hi; My car's registration validity finishing next month.Model is 2004 Kindly advise the formalities for re registration.	You can renew your registration any time; they are concerned with the fee; you just go directly to the inspection place; pay 75QR and they will inspect your car; once it is finished and passed; then process the insurance and go to Traffic Police. If you will not renew till the expiry date; it has one month grace period also.	1

Dont ever rent a car in qatar. and if you want to rent go for some reputed rental companies. these street rentacar companies are rip off.	1

Truth real estate should be called Lies real estate. I've started dealing with them and they seem quite bad. Before I moved in; they promised the rent included cleaning; but I've found it doesn't. I've given them cheques but it's taking a long time to get a lease. You definitely can't trust these people. I suggest you don't pay the agents commission until you get the lease in your hands and I would suggest you don't move out until you get your deposit back.	1

Any advice out there?	Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	1

I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	1

Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	1

Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Here I actually mean women from China; Phillipines and Thailand..Easy prey for western men..In other countries South Asia and Middle east women are not availabl.....	0

Why donÂ´t you date our friend here; Gineeshlee; he wants more than sex...or so it seems. Anyways; on a serious note. IÂ´ve seen too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately...and you know what; Qataries are much better behaved than that. At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut. If you behave like a lady; chances are that you might find someone that treats you like a lady.	0

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	1

I am married with no kids and considering a reasonable life style.	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0
Kindly someone tell me; specially if there is someone from pakistan; is there any visit visa available for pakistanis?

You can get visit visas but you should have any blood living in Qatar. Otherwise; you have to apply for tourist visa through Qatar Airways and have to pay for hotel accomodation as well.	1

Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly.	Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	1

Car insurance not really that bad. In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car. So anyone can drive the car and still insured. If you know what i mean. We pay around 2000 QR for our cars. Again our car are not a posh car. :-)	1

I think you will find that the car is covered for accidents but not people in the car. You may need to take out seperate insurance for the passengers. Fully comprehensive in Qatar is not the same as fully comprehensive in the UK	1

Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly.	Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.	1

When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.	1

A school that follows the English National Curriculum; even though most of the students are Qataris and the staff are from Australia or South Africa? Or is it a school where the main medium of instruction is English; albeit that Arabic is the language of the playground? "IB" stands for "International Baccalaureate".

An English school is one were all teachers are English (ok we'll let in the Welsh; Scots and maybe even the Irish; SA et al) and have taught the National Curriculum in the UK.

It's been almost 8 weeks now and I'm concerned it will take much longer; especially hearing some of the stories here (6 months to get a visa!)	I have pretty much given them everything they need. I have already been offered the job and signed the contract. I was told they are sorting out my entry visa which is a 3-8 week process; and when this is sorted they would organise my flights to come to Doha. So I'm really not sure how it all works from here...	0

I think if you have already signed the contract then there is nothing to worry about. Relax; HMC is not going to cheat you. They might have applied for a bunch of visas; hence the delay. Good luck.	1

It has now been over 3 months and is getting very frustrating! I am being kicked out of my current job because they can no longer afford to keep me here any longer. 3 months for an entry visa and still counting! I can only imagine what more things I have to do before they will fly me to Qatar. Is this normal? Every story I hear; it seems the maximum one has to wait is 4 weeks for an entry visa!	0

Hi all; here to discuss the cars prices in Qatar and the best auto deal. All advices for cars in DOHA!	Qatar does not have websites for most commerce. Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars. Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.	0

I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible.. THEY DONT SERVICE THE CAR AT ALL..JUST DO OIL AND FILTER CHANGE ALL THE TIME... ASK THEM FOR SERVICE AND THEY WILL TALK OF A SCHEDULE OF LEAVING THE CAR THERE FOR FEW DAYS (USUALLY 3 DAYS)... IF YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF A DENT ON YOUR CAR..IT WILL TAKE A WEEK FOR THEM TO REPAIR IT... WHY SELL CARS IF YOU CANT SERVICE THEM?? NISSAN CARS ARE REALLY GOOD..but the dealership at QATAR is a living SHAME...	0

Does anyone know what charges are involved and is there any info online? Regards PS- what's the weather like there in April?	Hi; I am having some of my goods shipped over from the UK and wanted some advice about port charges/service etc. Items I'm bringing are things like books/manuals and clothes/toileteries etc...	We didn't get charged anything extra at this end. Give a note to the courier company stating it's personal belongings and you will be taking them back when you leave Qatar; then they will give it to customs. Hopefully; you won't get charged either. *****If you haven't got anything nice to say; don't say anything at all*****	1

Find a good forwarder in the UK who could deliver your stuff door-to-door (that's DDP; Delivered Duty Paid for Incoterms 2000); so receiver should not worry about anything to pay as shipper will pay all the charges before it can be shipped out from the UK to Qatar. DHL; UPS and Fedex can handle this kind of shipment; just dont forget; Shipping Terms should be DDP in the Airway Bill. btw; April weather starts to warm; hot season's peak July and August Cheers!	1

Yep; give it to the courier company with your belongings in the UK. We had a door to door service too; but we used a small company.

I recently shipped a large shipment of goods from the US via Allied Shipping. I paid the US company; they inventoried; packed; boxed; and shipped everything here to Qatar.

Hi all; here to discuss the cars prices in Qatar and the best auto deal. All advices for cars in DOHA!	Qatar does not have websites for most commerce. Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars. Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.	0

I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible.. THEY DONT SERVICE THE CAR AT ALL..JUST DO OIL AND FILTER CHANGE ALL THE TIME... ASK THEM FOR SERVICE AND THEY WILL TALK OF A SCHEDULE OF LEAVING THE CAR THERE FOR FEW DAYS (USUALLY 3 DAYS)... IF YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF A DENT ON YOUR CAR..IT WILL TAKE A WEEK FOR THEM TO REPAIR IT... WHY SELL CARS IF YOU CANT SERVICE THEM?? NISSAN CARS ARE REALLY GOOD..but the dealership at QATAR is a living SHAME...	0

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	1

I am married with no kids and considering a reasonable life style.	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0

That comment (I read the article) must have been taken out of context by the journalist because it makes no sense as a follow-on quote. She can't surely mean 'afford' monetarily; but it is hard to decipher what else she could mean. Maybe they can't 'afford' to finance in the sense that it undermines and sends a message that the independent schools are not up to standard? Even that is quite a weak attempt to understand her. Puzzling.	0

Always fill up when your tank is half empty - petrol stations are far between! Stick to the speed limits.

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....	1

I'm an expat (western); only English speaking; currently a resident of Qatar (family sponsorship); with a degree. I've been persuing employment opportunties at QA (commercial).	It's a really crappy company; divided and having problems with their staff; and they treat the stewardesses really bad. Latest news is that a memo was circulated last week that bans the stewardesses for doing anything than staying at home when on standby; and that they need to get 12 hours of rest before each flight. This leaves them without a social life. The administration and and management treat everyone like garbage - in Europe this would be impossible but here its the way it is; they can always get some more Indians or Easter European. In the lastest 6 months 25 - 33 % of the staff has resigned or been fired so they always need new people. Salary wise it's ok - staff wise it sucks big time - I took the blue pill and found myself alive in Qatar - wish I had taken the red and stayed in Europe	1

I had a very big hard experience with the way that salesmen behavior. they don't want you to concentrate to purchase or get your free one as you like . I strongly suggest yateem or Qatar optics are good. and maybe there are so many good stores I din't mentioned I apologize. and for the store I had not been satisfied I tell soon or lator you will discover that you need to change sales managers and some sales men for their bad performance.	1

I was wondering if you can tell me how is life with a toddler in such a hot country? What do you mums do all day to keep them occupied? Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much	Good evening to everybody; we are moving to Doha in April and I am staying at home with our daughter of 17 months. Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat.	Hi; I have 3 children and they love the outdoors but during the summer months I send them out only after sunset because it's really hot and we have a lot of sand storms or dust storms so then it's either malls or playing indoors at friends homes. There are a few mother and toddler groups that do fun activities so you could join them. July and August are school holidays here so many go on vacations. Ramadan is also around this time so no eating or drinking outside and shops open late too. Best of luck with your move.	1

I know several families where the wife leaves for Europe as of mid-june until end of Aug. You have to be creative to keep them busy since Doha offers very little to keep kids busy (unless you want spend 3-4 hours in a mall each day).	0

Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat.	Us "mums"; A.K.A. stay-at-home-dads; get together with other mums and dads; and have outings to the zoo; park; beach; water front; park; park and park. It's only hot for a few months; so plenty of chances to get out and about with out the kids melting. Plenty of classes such as music classes; gymnastics (for toddlers); playgroups and other things. We have found Doha very much geared toward families with children. Whilst we hear our single friends complain about Doha being too boring; people like us can only dream of the days when we could sleep in for two days if we felt like it. Don't worry; Doha is a very family-friendly place with many activities inside and out; for children. Cheers	0

Hi; My husband getting job offer at Doha Qatar and we are moving from USA to Doha in September; based on what we read on the site it seems like Doha is not safe anymore. I am little nervous since i have to be at home all the time; taking care of two kids. As per my husband offer we will get 4-5BHK compound villa. Is it safe to be in compound Villa? Also; how is the social life at Doha especially; evening...as we here in USA; as a female I could go anytime with my infant for grocery or mall shopping but how is it in Doha? Also; i saw that everyone said drive carefully. Any help greatly appreciated. Thank You;	0

When we shifted from UK to Doha; we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families. To answer your question; yes a compound villa should be plenty safe. Crime is very very low in Qatar. We have fire extinguishers & smoke alarms in our rented villa; if you are worried about fires. Re health; we had a good experience with the general children's hospital when our child was sick. Lots of concerned doctors; all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given. Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler. You can go shopping anywhere and anytime the shops are open; on your own or with your child; in tshirts/shortsleeve blouses and jeans/skirt. No need for head/face coverings or your husband by your side. This is quite common for locals and expats here. Re driving; I find that there is hardly any road courtesy; lots of big car.....	0

Can I drive in Egypt with my Qatari driving license? ?	And can it be changed to Egyptian driving license or do I need to go through driving test etc.	Qatar Driving License General Qatari residents must carry a valid Qatari driving licence. GGC State Nationals are permitted to use their National Driving Licenses. As a visitor (other nationals) to Qatar; your national driving licence is acceptable for seven days from your date of arrival in the country. If you wish to rent a car for longer than the seven days (but do not intend to take up permanent residence) you will require a temporary driving license. If you are keen to drive during your first few months in Qatar; it is worth obtaining an International Licence before you get here. An International Driving License is valid for 6 months from the date of your arrival in Qatar. Getting a driving license depends on what country you are from. Citizens from most western countries such as Canada and the U.K. can change their drving licenses for Qatari ones. Other nationalities have to do a driving test which is actually quite difficult. In most cases the procedure for issuing a local licence just includes an eye test and a simple written test. However; it is necessary to hold a residence permit in order to apply for a Qatari driving licence. The Procedure Temporary Driving License The following items are required for a Temporary Driver's license (TDL): a) Original drivers license from home country. b) Eye examination. c) Process fees QR156 (about $45). d) Four personal photos (with eye glasses; if required). e) Copy of Passport An appointment for the eye examination will be set up for you by the HR Department and you will be informed of the time and date for the appointment. Permanent Drivers License Converting the Temporary Driver's License to a Permanent Driver's License requires the following: a) Temporary Drivers License (TDL). b) Two photos. c) Copy of Passport and Residence Permit. d) Process fees of QR156 (about $45).	1

Has anybody dragged very reluctant teenagers to Qatar? How did they adapt after getting there. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to cope with this behaviour?

My 14yr old was initially quite keen but as time is getting closer to us leaving home he is protesting and being very negative about coming to Qatar.	First of all;find out the exact reasons for this behaviour.Try to find out his likes and dislikes.His areas of interest. Once this is done;see if Qatar can match his life style.Please donot make any false promises(even unknowingly) because this can worsen the situation. As soon as you reach here;make it an exciting experience for him.May be taking hium around to places he would like to visit or things he would like to do will help. There are many QLers with children of that age;so socialising will not be a problem at all. We'll see you here.	1

My 14yr old was initially quite keen but as time is getting closer to us leaving home he is protesting and being very negative about coming to Qatar.	My mom's friends have kids between the ages of 14-16. Their parents don't let them do much because they can't really do anything here aside from school; mall; and swimming parties in compounds. And from coping with the behavior? Not moving to Qatar will help. He's in his teen years and he's probably into doing senseless things (like when we were at that period in our lives); so.. you might want to have a second thought. But then again; he's a guy.. so; it's much better than having to drag a teen daughter to the middle east.	1

You can promise him somethings that he like if he comes to Doha. Do not know what he might find in Qatar tempting for him. This is the only way. Also since he is growing up; tell him that he will be the "man" looking after his mother and taking care of her. Teenagers at this age might like this role. Good luck	1

I've contacted a few bus rental places (Thrifty; al-Muftah) and their prices are around QR750.  Is it possible just to hire a private guy who drives a bus around?  Giving him a reasonable per hourly wage; QR400 should be enough.	0

Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	i cant confirm; but i hope they wont qatarize cleaning jobs	0

Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	1
Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be "unskilled" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold.	1
Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	light of the subject but think it is a valid point that gumby made; if there are people willing to do the job; myself included but the positions are empty being reserved for Qatari's it seems so pointless :( please excuse me I am at the moment mesmerised by the above signature!!!! lol	0

Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	the "pecking" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment. If the jobs have been vacant for so long; do you actually need the jobs?	0

I would appreciate feedback from anyone who has actually invested / or planning to invest in this project... Whats the flip side/ disadvantages of investing in Pearl Qatar.....	I have read several newspaper reports about peral qatar and how its thrown open for expats to invest in this project. With land prices and rentals shooting up in Doha; I felt it would be better to invest in Pearl Qatar and this would only be an appreciating asset...	and am thinking of doing the same. Concerns are cost of finance; time to completion; an American attack on Iran; quality of finishings; size of deposit and finally; but far from least; property law and owner's right for foreigners in Qatar. We had better live as we think; otherwise we shall end up by thinking as we lived. - Paul Bourget	0

From what i've read about it; it is considered to be a good investment and definetly the prices will go up; expected around 20% at least within next few years. As for the completion date; i wouldn't worry to much about the delays cause the first towers that were supposed to be there by dec 2007 -will be there. I know a person who bought an apartmant in those first towers. unless something really bad and unexpected happens ; there shouldn't be any worry about your investment in the Pearl.	1

The lowest I have found so far is 1700 which is pretty good but anyone know of anything lower?? ?	I am looking for the cheapest rental car (personal use not through a company) for one month.	hey. 1700 is pretty good-but it depends on what car you're looking for. im also renting a car at the moment but looking to buy one very soon as it works out much cheaper! Also; if you get in an accident- the car has insurance; but from what I've seen- the car rental companies require you to pay 2;500- even its not your fault. furthermore; the insurance will not cover everything; and you may have to pay an additional amount. please be careful :)	1

Please tell me this is not so; any thoughts out there as to somewhere else to take my car?? ?	I have just had a call from Nissan Service Centre (Ind area) about the cost to fix my AC on my car - just shy of 20;000QAR!! Call me old fashioned but does this not seem rather alot to pay and it was almost as if the guy was glad to be telling me; like he was proud to rip off his customers.	Nissan is a rip off; get your car fixed outside for fraction of the price. To fix your ac they will tell you ten other items need to be replaced; plus labour charges and you will end up keeping your car with them for a week or so. For 20k you can buy another second hand car :P	0

Option # 1 Take your car to Madina market # 2; opposite Mercedez in Industrial area; just near to the main bridge. So many are there to fix up just for Qar. 300 only. Mr. Najam 55215605 Bengali. It is a coil that he would replace for Qar. 200/300. Optionn # 2; Go to Japan Autos in street 26; buy a used AC compressor for Qar. 500 with the coil and get is replaced. Both the options work fine.	1

I dont understand how they get away with it; repairing or servicing a car should be within affordable standards to the average person. Its not like their parts are any cheaper compared to when buying them from outside.	0

Hello! Well pests do exist everywhere and Qatar is no exception.The general standard of cleaniness is fairly good here and surely wont dissapoint.If you are goig to live in a compound then will be maintainance and cleaning as well.So no worries there.	1

If you have a villa such problems would be minimal to nil in my experience. In apartments; often the case is no matter how clean you are - your neighbours standards may not be up to yours and the bugs get in. Again; not as if you were living like an unhygenic family; but the bugs know no boundaries.	1

Mel1! a warm welcome to qatar. To be 100% sure you don't confront these stupid bugs; I suggest you to ensure that your villa is newly constructed; ie you are going to be the first occupant. Also ensure that it has been furnished with new furnitures and not the refurbished or that are shifted from somewhere where it was in use. If the furniture is new; the chances of bed bugs welcoming you will be minimal. During your tenure here; keep your kitchen oil free (difficult!) and maintain overall hygiene and you will be well off. All in all qatar is a small and beautiful country. Just make sure you don't introduce few new species in qatar. :)	0

Could your check-in agent upgrade you or would they need clearance? Anyone work for QR or has any insight?	I've always wondered who at Qatar Airways would have the authority to upgrade you.

Any tips? Is it okay to wear shorts when entering the temples? Is the rail ride safe?	Visiting Golden Triangle in India.

What is acceptable?"	My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told "long sleeves and long skirts". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro.....	1

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..	0

We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear "normal" clothes; this is totally acceptable for "western ladies". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela	1

Like western men can wear full dress even in summer so why not women; its islamic country and as per norm i would like to recommend you to come out fully covered.Thanks! Welcome to Qatar	1

Salam Aisha-Taweela; just to correct you habibti...all the Muslim women are not 'totally covered up' as you said. Did you mean shayla and niqab? There are thousands of Muslim women in Qatar wearing typical western clothing with head uncovered.	1

also is the qatar driving license is valid in Dubai?	i will be moving to saudi soon i want to know if its possible to use the exsisting driving license to driving in saudi.	Get yourself an international license based on your Qatari one as a temporary measure; however once resident you MUST have a valid Saudi one.	1
also is the qatar driving license is valid in Dubai?	i will be moving to saudi soon i want to know if its possible to use the exsisting driving license to driving in saudi.	Yes! It is possible! All you have to do is go to travels Agency or ticketing agent and I apply for international drivers license to what countries you want? They will charges you for a 100 riyals or more and give you papers allowing you to drive that country as they guarantor agency.	1
also is the qatar driving license is valid in Dubai?	i will be moving to saudi soon i want to know if its possible to use the exsisting driving license to driving in saudi.	But in Saudi you can only drive on an International license on a visit or business visa. once you have residence you MUST transfer to a Saudi License.	0

For a short period like a week or so u can drive rent a car in any GCC country but if u shifting permanently u cant use qatar license. I guess u can convert qatar license to Saudi license easily.	1
also is the qatar driving license is valid in Dubai?	i will be moving to saudi soon i want to know if its possible to use the exsisting driving license to driving in saudi.	Jesuis; sorry YOU are wrong; see my previous post and that of "baedaebok" at the top. As a GCC National; yes you can. If you are still resident in Qatar; yes you can; but once you are resident in KSA you must get a KSA License - I was the for 8 years prior to coming here. I know - I have BOTH!	1
also is the qatar driving license is valid in Dubai?	i will be moving to saudi soon i want to know if its possible to use the exsisting driving license to driving in saudi.	yes you can drive with your Qatri licence if you have only your Qatari car but once you want to be resident the guys already answer you enough just change the license without any driving test as there is an agreement for the Gulf countries	1

Where can I buy wheat free products; or milk free products; or cheese free products?	My children have recently been diagnosed with food allergies.	I have started cooking from scratch which is probably healthier but its time consuming with three different diets. In the UK you can buy wheat free; milk free and lactose free products. I did find wheat free flour sporadically from Megamart and Soya milk isn't too hard to find but most of it tastes bad.	1
Where can I buy wheat free products; or milk free products; or cheese free products?	My children have recently been diagnosed with food allergies.	I am suppose to be wheat intolerant but in this country I have given up and am bloated all the time. Mega mart also has wheat free flour to make your own bread; doubles up great for pizza bases; carrefore occasionally stocks wheat free nut bread. Simple treat for you to try is 1 c peanut butter; 1 c sugar; 1 egg. Mix all together; put spoonfuls on a greased tray and bake at 180 for about 20min (golden). They may come out a little soft but will harden. Good luck!   I may be blonde but I am wise smile lots laugh more	0
Where can I buy wheat free products; or milk free products; or cheese free products?	My children have recently been diagnosed with food allergies.	Megamart does have the best selection. Edensoy milk is some of the best tasting (especially vanilla). It comes fortified in some varieties. Read labels on everything. If the product is from the US; it will list CONTAINS MILK in bold letters on the bottom of the ingredients. Some poptarts are milk free (cinnamon; strawberry; and apple flavor). Be cautious with chocolate. Milk is in all Cadbury chocolate. Some dark brands are vegan. Megamart also has Soya margarine and "Smart Balance" butterflavored spread on occasion. My advice is to stock up when they have it! Also be careful when buying bread; as many have milk as an ingredient. I haven't found any dairy-free cheese in doha. Is the allergy just cow's milk? Can goat or sheep cheese be used? The pharmacy in City Center has chewy bears calcium vitamins if you are looking for supplements. Good luck.	0

Any recommendations?	I have been here since November and not managed to get a decent haircut yet!	Some little barber shops dotted around Al-Sadd; cheap and they will give you lots of attention; haircut; shave and sometiimes pull your fingers till they crack.   I go to this place and they switch the tv to the english tv for me to watch and sometimes shout for a tea.   True the haircut might not be great or good but its a fun little adventure and much more exciting than going to the fancy hotels barbers; plus it supports my local businesses of Al-Sadd.

I went to Patrice at Villaggio and was deeply disappointed. They charged QAR 75. The price wasn't what I was after; I just wanted a decent cut! I'd call my session there HAIRCHOP! The guy who did my hair was not involved for a more than a minute trying to find out what I wanted and this is the worst cut I had since my mother did a "pot cut" for me when I was 5 or 6 years old. The Filipino hair dressers carried on a loud conversation between themselves discussing their personal problems; living arrangements etc. 	0

Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...	1

Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold. I will also contact Doha Vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival.	0

Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&num=20&form=search&gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this. Hope it all goes well for you and your daughter's dog. Have to say though; August is an awfully brutal month to be bringing the poor thing out there; hope it doesn't have a full coat!	0

Nomerci is right about the action flicks and well as the chick-flicks. Rags to riches movies also do have an effect on the less fortunate who strive hard to complete their education and work harder to get noticed.	1

Recently; someone stated "People get their values from the silver screen."	of course the mass media/movie production can change society. But i wouldn't use word "help". "help" is something positive; while mass production can affect society very negatively. Movie can definitely form a certain images; pattern behavior; stereotypes; etc. All Film companies reduce the number of smoking scenes in their films; some of them have banned these scenes completely. Movie creates stereotypes that are followed by people. Girls want to look; to be dressed and to behave as their favorite actress. Guys want to act like their hero acts. This is normal process. Brit; one separate movie might not help one individual become better (but also MIGHT help); but creating a whole image of certain behavior and stereotypes in the society definitely can make this society better (or worse)	1

Thank you so much Anna ; Rizks and Babesphil... that's what my friend is going to do. He will be leaving in the Philippines for Hongkong for a tour purpose. He will be staying there for 3 days to consume his tour package. After 3 days he will be taking a flight to Doha. My follow-up question is that; is it convenient to just purchase a ticket there in Hongkong bound for Doha since it's cheaper I guess or I'll just buy for him a ticket here where I purchased his tourist visa? And is it just ok if it's only a one way ticket (Hongkong-Doha)? Will the Hongkong immigration scrutinize this one way ticket? So sorry for asking too much as my friend is really worried same as me.	0

You just go down to immigration in Al gharaffa or the airport office with your ID and your sons Id and passport and ask for a multiple exit permit for 1 year.

My advise is to get a multi exit permit; which cost you only QAR 500; but saves you a ton of headache. No need for any form to fill; just take your son's passport; your ID; and go to the airport immigration dept; and make sure to clearly ask for multiple-exit permit option to the person processing your request.	1

In Islam we only worship Allah & we follow the Prophet in doing this so even our calendar is based on the Muslims first Hejra (departures from Makkah to Madinah ) cause this is a public concern for Muslims but whether the prophet is exist or not nothing will change so his birthday or else is not a holiday & if you really love him then do as he said follow him in the way he used to worship Allah the Almighty.	1

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	1

I am married with no kids and considering a reasonable life style.	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0

Is this true? Obviously I'll contact the Indian embassy tomorrow; but just wondered if anyone out there knows for sure?	My daughter has just been on a school trip to India; got back to Doha 2 weeks ago. We have booked a family holiday in Goa; first week in April; but now someone has told me that you cannot re-enter India within a 6 month period. I'm freaking out; as we'll have to cancel if that's the case.	The biggest joke ever heard; absolutely you wont be having any problems entering india anytime. Just submit your ticket and relevant documents related to your tour; it will be easy for processing.	1

I tried to do the same one time at the embassy in Doha; and they told me to come back after 1pm. When I came back after 1pm; they then told me they were closed; and refused to see me. In the end I cancelled my trip and have never been back to India.	1

Will this be enough to live on?	I have been offered a teaching post in Doha. An apartment will be provided along with medical cover and a few other benefits such as travel to work each day. I have been offered 8500 QAR per month; which is around £1400 per month. This is a huge pay cut for me. After my UK expenses I'm left with just over £200 of 1500 QAR per month.	NO! Why; oh; why would you want to take a pay cut to come here??? This is not a kind place to those who are struggling financially. Let me just say that after skimping on food; you won't be able to go anywhere (no car) and you will have no money with which to do anything. Great life; huh? Mandi	1

Thanks; is 8500 QAR pm not a good salary then? I am meeting with the school principle and company directors next week; I'm going to try and increase my salary then. Ideally I'm looking for 1200 QAR as that more closely compares to my after tax salary here in the UK.	0

Hello dear; I am not sure what to tell you but each one of us is looking for something different and also in a different situation; the short answer is No unless you are here to join a family member or planing on staying here for few month till something else open up; Qatar is relatively expensive compared to many close by destinations but it could be decent and moderate for those who know how to save; wish u best of luck.	1

The rule of thumb for expat salaries is your salary in the US/UK plus 25% plus housing; transportation; medical; air tickets; etc. Please realize there isn't public transportation per se in Qatar. The Qatar government won't even let anyone bring a spouse unless their base salary is over 10;000. I'd say that's the line for "middle-class." But again; why would you even be tempted? They are offering you peanuts and that's a real sign of how they will treat you later. Mandi	1

Oh; and you must know about needing exit permits and that you cannot change jobs. (You probably can't even get a loan with that salary; not that you would want one.)

I have been offered 8500 QAR per month; which is around £1400 per month. This is a huge pay cut for me. After my UK expenses I'm left with just over £200 of 1500 QAR per month.	8500 QR a month; why would you accept that? I hope you are not a maths teacher or economics. Maybe you teach religious education and are crazy; in that case you should accept.	0

Thank you guys for your help. I have the offer letter in front of me. The school is offering 8500 QAR a month; free accommodation; flights; medical care; plus a company bonus and gratuity after 1 years service. From what I've read from you; the school are taking the p***. I'm not sure what NOC is; can someone explain? I have a meeting on the 5th and would appreciate any advice on how to deal with salary negotiations. I am hoping to raise the salary to 13000 QAR. Which (after UK expenses leaves 8500 QAR of disposable income) Is that a reasonable salary to live on?	0

An NOC is a "no objection certificate." You cannot change jobs within Qatar without one. Schools don't generally give them. So if you want to leave your first employer in Qatar you must wait 2 years before working in Qatar again. Mandi	1

And all but your accommodation are required of employers in Qatar; so they aren't being that generous with the benefits. Let us know; but I'd be surprised if they came up to 13;000. Good luck.

Hello everyone; i am coming to Doha soon from South Africa and i beleive that once i am there i need an exit permit to leave; does anyone know what this means.

Hello everyone; i am coming to Doha soon from South Africa and i beleive that once i am there i need an exit permit to leave; does anyone know what this means.	you only need an exit permit once you have got a Residence Permit (RP).

So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit! Also make sure they have done your business visa before you fly out so it is sorted for when you land!	1

Any advice out there?	Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	1

I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	1

Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	1

Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating.

Why donÂ´t you date our friend here; Gineeshlee; he wants more than sex...or so it seems. Anyways; on a serious note. IÂ´ve seen too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately...and you know what; Qataries are much better behaved than that. At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut. If you behave like a lady; chances are that you might find someone that treats you like a lady.	1

Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...	1

Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold.

Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&num=20&form=search&gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this. Hope it all goes well for you and your daughter's dog. Have to say though; August is an awfully brutal month to be bringing the poor thing out there; hope it doesn't have a full coat!	1

Time to put your YT on a diet????? The airline website will give you the maximum dimensions of the carrier (but do not be put off by the height restriction; as these special carriers squash down to the maximum allowed height ~20 cm I think)	1

Yorkies average in at 2-3 kg; my cat is 4 kg and these carriers are designed to be super light; for this exact purpose! Bar chiuauas; I cannot think of a lighter dog. It's worth pursing anyway and DohaVets and the airlines are experts on this; so don't be disheartened. You don't get anywhere without trying....	1

I'm on a roll now - if you check the link I posted; the type of carrier you will need weighs in at 900g...to go over the recommended weight allowance; that would have to be one hell of an obese Yorkie !!! ;-)	1

Will the situation improve?....	Funny Mowasalat Bus Routes.....they never intersect each other...and they never ply on the main roads like C-Ring or D-Ring roads They could have run a service from Wakrah-Al Khor-Wakrah as a single service (around 80kms) thorugh the C-Ring Road...right now its split into 3 or four service. Another through the D-Ring from the Airport to North Khalifa area would have been good too. Till now they have just 1 Bus Station.	Nope it's not going to improve. It was a horribly planned venture.	1

What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	if Estafa is what MJ said; then what Human rights can do with that? Honestly; I think nobody can do anything about it; unless there is a legal written contract of lending/borrowing money. Even in this case the procedure is way too long and you might end up with giving to the lawyers much more money than you are owed... <i> <b> ********************* You become responsible forever for what you have tamed.

What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	You have 3 options. You may lodged a complaint or blotter with any nearest police station. If he is a foreigner; the police will give him a visit together with your complaint. If the respondent will not own up; they can file your complaint with the prosecutors. If the respondent is Qatari; you go to the Ministry of Human Rights and they will assist you there. You may also try your embassy which normally have legal officers familiar with local criminal procedures to assist you. Good Luck.	1
What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	Qatar criminal and civil procedures are unique in the entire gulf region. It has both the regular courts and the sharia courts. For estafa or deceit; it is normally filed with a complaint with the prosecutor and after preliminary investigation; it will be filed with the Court of First Instance. You need not hire a lawyer since the prosecutor will be your lawyer. But bear in mind to produce evidence on estafa or deceit. If you have no documentary exhibits forget your complaint and charge it to experience. Sharia courts handle family relations law and criminal cases involving Qataris and muslim litigants. Cases involving foreigners; civil or criminal are handled by regular courts.	1
What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	Evidence is very important in criminal prosecution. Oral testimony will not prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt; the quantum of evidence required to convict an accused in a criminal prosecution. The rejoinder of qatarisun is well taken; your respondent can easily deny having received money from you or simply say that the money is simple loan; and you have no case for estafa. The essential element of estafa is "trust" and "exchange of goods or money". Prove this both and you have a case for estafa.	1
What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	the formality or informality of your document is immaterial. What is material for your case to prosper in ourt is the substance of your document. It must show the nature of your transaction; mentions the goods or money he received; his name and signature thereon; and any witnesses to the transaction. If you parted goods or money based on his representations; and which you awfully trusted; and his promise or acknowledgement of paying you back; and he reneged on this promise; then you have a criminal case for deceit or estafa.	1
What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	there you have it; your reference to the word "borrowed" presuppose the existence of a simple loan; and your allegations for estafa is doomed. electronic mails or emails are now admissible in evidence in courts under certain qualifications. but what you have on hand is evidence of simple loan not estafa. in which case; if the amount involved is substantial; you are advised to seek a local lawyer to assist you in filing a simple case for sum of money and damages. Legal fees here are quite expensive; prepare with your deep wallet.	1
What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	Ms J; promissory notes are not evidence of estafa but of loan. Promissory notes are ancillary documents to the principal contracts of loan. If one cannot pay his loan; you do not sue him for estafa even if this is accompanied promissory notes and with rubber checks. Issuance of bounching checks are not punishable as a crime in Qatar if that is what you have in mind.	1

What government agency should I go to ask some legal advice?	I am a female overseas contract worker here in Qatar who is a victim of estafa.	Cheques and Promissory notes are admissible in evidence for civil cases such as Collection Cases for sum of money; Judicial Foreclosure of Mortgage; etc. but not for ciminal prosecution of estafa or deceit. While checks may have probative value to establish motive or intent it is not the quantum of proof to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Promissory Notes on the other hand will disprove estafa since this document will clearly establish a loan transaction. The safest way in transaction involving forebearance of money or exchange of goods for money is to have a contract or document that clearly specify the nature of transaction. Never get swayed by sweet talking persons and you might end up scammed.	1

Some schools do have buses (for an extra fee); the problem is with the timings - I've seen kids out as early as 0530 hrs waiting for their bus (and school doesn't actually start until 0700 or 0730 hrs). However; they seem to be mainly Arab or Asian children - so I assume they are attending Arab or Asian schools. You need to get your kids' on the waiting lists for your preferred schools now as the better schools that have the American and British Curriculum are very popular with those expat (and other) communities.

(am i missing anything?) wish it were as simple as arriving; finding a school; and moving into a place.. but everything depends on the other; so it's a bit confusing right now.	0

So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit! Also make sure they have done your business visa before you fly out so it is sorted for when you land!	1

I have a close friend and she's leaving w/ all the rest of the family to Abu dhabi still there are many who come here but those who stay for long i guess are very few.

The label should be placed on the bottom or side if the retailer teaches his staff how to properly label those imported items. But of course; that is not clearly important to the staff in this country like other countries that care about good service; so just sayn; or wishful thinking that logically it should not go just anywhere on the item. I know in USA the vendors of the food items come into the stores to stock the shelves and label and arrange them for marketing; & bigger profits.... not the in-house staff.

As nomad said; the photo section of Salam is the Canon dealer here; though other stores stock stuff as well. However; prices of photographic equipment seems to be very expensive in Qatar. Better to order it in from abroad.	1

Has anyone seen this island?? Where is it ? Is it near to Corniche ?	The Qatar banana island will be transfered by the end of 2013 to 5 stars resort called Anantara.	Why there? I have enjoyed many visits to the island; and was under the illusion that it was there for everyone to enjoy. I could be wrong; but it would seem that it is probably going to be out of bounds to casual visitors in future. On the flip side; the island is man made. So I guess whoever made it must have had a good reason to pop an island right next to a massive new shiny international airport; and this is probably it. In which case; the owners can do what they like with their island. Well there ya go; I have answered my own question.	0

What can I wear? What can't I wear? Can I wear knee length dresses and skirts? Can they be just above the knee?	I'm moving to Qutar on Friday (in 2days.	You have to remember that Qatar is a conservative Muslim Country by Law; but as with most places a lot of the rules are bent here. The one thing you have to remember which was states before you do not want to wear something that is to revealing so that people do not give you a hard time. For females you can wear whatever you want but then you have to deal with the after math of having inappropriate comments being made and in some cases harassment from both the people and the police. For men its is a lot easier but some times the same problems arise. So the best advice i can give is that you dress for the summer but nothing to revealing.	1

I'm using Al Manhal and the water sodium is medium; and the taste is not bad. Once a week delivery though unless you call (they will delivery 1-2 more depending on how low your family is). Their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back; but delivered to your door! My roommate also uses Wataniya; which for the first month is super service; multiple times a week. Then seems to not be so super. But that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew (he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am). The differences between the two is Al Manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles; and Wataniya's bottles almost 100% look brand new. Wataniya's taste isn't quite as good as Al Manhal's but still not bad at all.	1

But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year. Here's where some extra expenses might figure into the mix... So; not bad; but that salary is rather low for a PhD.	1
What are your comments?	Many Indian schools here took winter vacations before actual winter started to join eid with christmas. They started vacations from eid instead of Christmas to help parents of all enjoy eid and christmas. But my kids now finding it very difficult to wake up for school.

Just be calm friend..They r kids after all..They will adjust soon..Try to make them understand with ur love and not by yelling on them..It may give opposite result..It does happen with we adults as well coz of the wintery feel in DOHA from december to february-march..We too feel lazy to wake up for our office sometimes...So be chill...	0

Its not due to long vacations but due to falling temperatures kids are reluctant to wake up. Hence I feel vacations should not be disturbed to facilitate parents or teachers. Do you justify taking vacations in advance?	1

My daughter is still small to go for school..But i can understand ur problem..Noone can force schools to go as per one's own wish..School authorities r fully responsible towards their children..So evenif i want to justify my stand on vacation;its not gonna to sort out the problem..	0

Is it the kids find it difficult to get up or the parents who get up early to make kids ready ?... LOL	0

I was wondering if you can tell me how is life with a toddler in such a hot country? What do you mums do all day to keep them occupied? Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much	Good evening to everybody; we are moving to Doha in April and I am staying at home with our daughter of 17 months. Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat.	Hi; I have 3 children and they love the outdoors but during the summer months I send them out only after sunset because it's really hot and we have a lot of sand storms or dust storms so then it's either malls or playing indoors at friends homes. There are a few mother and toddler groups that do fun activities so you could join them. July and August are school holidays here so many go on vacations. Ramadan is also around this time so no eating or drinking outside and shops open late too. Best of luck with your move.	1

Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat.	most westerners escape summer heat especially july-august. I know several families where the wife leaves for Europe as of mid-june until end of Aug. You have to be creative to keep them busy since Doha offers very little to keep kids busy (unless you want spend 3-4 hours in a mall each day).	1

Us "mums"; A.K.A. stay-at-home-dads; get together with other mums and dads; and have outings to the zoo; park; beach; water front; park; park and park. It's only hot for a few months; so plenty of chances to get out and about with out the kids melting. Plenty of classes such as music classes; gymnastics (for toddlers); playgroups and other things. We have found Doha very much geared toward families with children. Whilst we hear our single friends complain about Doha being too boring; people like us can only dream of the days when we could sleep in for two days if we felt like it. Don't worry; Doha is a very family-friendly place with many activities inside and out; for children. Cheers	1

Is it better to leave to Europe in the summer?Thanks so much	Good evening to everybody; we are moving to Doha in April and I am staying at home with our daughter of 17 months. Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat.	Hi; My husband getting job offer at Doha Qatar and we are moving from USA to Doha in September; based on what we read on the site it seems like Doha is not safe anymore. I am little nervous since i have to be at home all the time; taking care of two kids. As per my husband offer we will get 4-5BHK compound villa. Is it safe to be in compound Villa? Also; how is the social life at Doha especially; evening...as we here in USA; as a female I could go anytime with my infant for grocery or mall shopping but how is it in Doha? Also; i saw that everyone said drive carefully. Any help greatly appreciated. Thank You;	0

Here she likes outdoors so much; I cannot imagine how it is done in such a heat.	Hi Papu21; Doha is quite a safe city. When we shifted from UK to Doha; we already knew that this place is generally very safe for families. To answer your question; yes a compound villa should be plenty safe. Crime is very very low in Qatar. We have fire extinguishers & smoke alarms in our rented villa; if you are worried about fires. Re health; we had a good experience with the general children's hospital when our child was sick. Lots of concerned doctors; all tests done to ensure nothing was missed and lots of consultations with other doctors to ensure proper medication and treatment was given. Most social activities happen in the evenings when weather is cooler. You can go shopping anywhere and anytime the shops are open; on your own or with your child; in tshirts/shortsleeve blouses and jeans/skirt. No need for head/face coverings or your husband by your side. This is quite common for locals and expats here. Re driving; I find that there is hardly any road courtesy; lots of big car.....	0

Since QLers are experts at the long flights; what's your favorite remedy for jet lag?	Well; the day of our arrival is fast approaching.	for the encouragement and the kind words. How does your daughter do with the flights? I'm a little concerned with my 4 year old; who's the restless one.	0
Since QLers are experts at the long flights; what's your favorite remedy for jet lag?	Well; the day of our arrival is fast approaching.	That's a great question! We have had a few flights to figure out what to do to keep her occupied and she was 2 and 3 at the time. We got her an iPod and loaded her favorite movies and music onto it. I took coloring books and regular books to read to her. I took a few toys that were small that she liked. We were also in Bus. class so she had a bigger choice in movies and music than her iPod. I also did not fight with her when everyone else was going to sleep. I let her stay awake and watch the movies; then when she was tired; she crashed out and slept for about 5-6 hours. You are going to be exhausted when you get here from trying to stay on top of your kiddo and keeping him/her occupied. It wasn't all great; we figured all this out over about 4 to 5 flights back and forth to the US. There are still some moments when she was fussy. Hope that helps a bit. Motherhood...The hardest job you'll ever love! : )	1

Anybody can please tell me; whether I can extend this futher more; maximum of how many months?	I'm currently in Doha on a 3 month Visit Visa.	you can also extend your tourist visa but very costly as compared with extending a family visit visa. maybe what you can do is exit from qatar then; after three months; apply again for a family visit visa (if you have a relative here)	1
Anybody can please tell me; whether I can extend this futher more; maximum of how many months?	I'm currently in Doha on a 3 month Visit Visa.	you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six months; but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 months limit; you can do that; too. i think upto 1 month; more. you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking details.	1
Anybody can please tell me; whether I can extend this futher more; maximum of how many months?	I'm currently in Doha on a 3 month Visit Visa.	hi rtaure..tnx.. what are the requirements in extending tourist visa and how much? if I exit; I can go back in qatar after 3 months?	0
Anybody can please tell me; whether I can extend this futher more; maximum of how many months?	I'm currently in Doha on a 3 month Visit Visa.	you guys are mixing Family visit visa and Tourist visit visa. Family visit visa (when you were sponsored by one of your family member)initially is valid for 1 month; and can be extended later for another 5 months (total 6 months stay) after undergoing Medical examination. Tourist visit visa is is valid for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days ; 60 days stay in total.	1
Any update on this I am HSBC customer and still they deduct same amount...

Recently I heard that QCB has instructed to reduce the loan interest to 6 % for the new and existing loan holders.	It's a new law. But you know how laws are treated in this country. Don't you?	1

Recently I heard that QCB has instructed to reduce the loan interest to 6 % for the new and existing loan holders.	I am surprised that you are so INNOCENT The banks here increase the interest even befor it can be really approved ; but when the central bank already decleared reduction of interest officialy ; these banks still wait and kill time till they implement as they want to SQUIZE the customers. The rule of the gane is simple: HEADS I WIN & TAILS YOU LOOSE and all this is called fair practice-hahahahahaha GOD BLESS	1

I thought if was a good starting point; since there seemst to be an organised group with membership for parents who teach curriucula full-time at home. On the other hand; your daughter is only three and from my experience (as a nursery teacher) at this age you should foucus on language development (not sure how many languages you teach to your child; but it gets more difficult if you are exponsing your child to two or three different languages); abc's and letter recognicion including reading small words and recongnising her own name in writting; counting and number recognition; colours;shapes arts and crafts and pencil control for tracing lines; numbers and letters.

ANy reliable series purchased online?	I want to start homeschooling dd (darling daughter). She's 3-years-old.	We will be moving to Doha in the early spring. I've homeschooled my children (now 10 and 12) their entire lives; so I've done pretty extensive research on homeschooling there. There is a Yahoo group for homeschoolers in Doha. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/DohaHomeEducators/ You could start with some basic info there. It's a pretty flexible group that meets whenever some member decides to set something up. Just about homeschooling in general: 3 is very young to begin formal schooling. I think I would focus on letting your child explore the world and reading lots of good books to her. But if you are determined; here's a good resource for younger kids: http://www.fiarhq.com/B4FIVEINAROW.html If you have any other questions; feel free to ask. Homeschooling has been a great experience for us. My husband's company has offered to pay for their tuition to a private school in Doha; but we are opting to continue homeschooling because it has been such a positive thing.	1

Well; Al Jazeera and Al Maha Academies don't have the best reputations in Doha but most teachers survive there for a year. I wouldn't be too surprised at no information.

My Australian friend came here to Doha under the Talum scheme... they did NOT look after her or her 2 children. Many people complain about Talum. The Al Maha School is very tight Muslim school and the people I know that work there as teachers are NOT happy. Don't know about the other school. They promise much and deliver little. My friend was paid 10;000 Qatar Riyals along with accommodation which was well below standard!!! Find some other agency but don't deal with them!!!! My friend finally got her children home to Australia after terrible expense and trouble. You cannot get out easily once you get here!!!! You have to apply for an exit visa and if you signed a 2 yr contract you are bound to stay whether you like it or not!!!! I hope you see this in time... FORGET IT!!!! :(	1

I don't want to be harsh but parent are equally responsible for inculcating proper educational values in a child. Parent should be more involved with the education of the child even if they are busy. Qatar is a place where you cannot rely completely on the teaching staff and tutoring the child is quite expensive. Unless the child is exceptionally talented he/she needs parental guidance.	1

How do we improve std of our childrens education?	My children didn't get good results this time from board exam. In BFPS results are pathetic. Because; lady principal send good qualified teacher to Pakistan. She is doing trial and error experiments with our children's future.	I agree with MOM_ME here... No school is either good or bad and yes there may be good and bad teachers given that in this part of the world its very diff to get qualified and experienced teachers as they are paid peanuts. BUT that being said we as parents are also in many ways responsible for the education of our children. Just studying the lessons in School arent enough. when they come home see that they revise their work everyday and do their home work on their own. Guide them properly and give them good books to read to expand their knowledge. A teacher only GUIDES the child. and if the teacher has not explaind the chapter well or you feel the child needs more then try to do the same at home or hire a tutor to help your child. That being said - every child has their limitations. We shudnt expect our children to perfom miracles nor bring in 100% results all the time. Just encourage your child to do better than the last time every time he sits for an exam and try NOT to create any PANIC or TENSION. every exam shud be approached with a cool head and DONT encourage your child to memorize. Teach them to UNDERSTAND the subject and study. That not only creates an interest but retention power is more.	1

Is it safe to work there? For women as well? Kindergardens for expats kids available? Is anyone looking strange at you at shopping and on the street?Cheers.Mihai	Hi there.	It's safer than Australia for both men and women. There are lots of kindergartens; just don't procrastinate finding one and getting acceptance. And yes; be prepared to be stared at constantly. Either just stare back or ignore it.	1

Women stare just as much as men; particularly at Western people.

Is it safe to work there? For women as well? Kindergardens for expats kids available? Is anyone looking strange at you at shopping and on the street?Cheers.Mihai	Hi there.	It is safe but I was a working mum and I found these diffciulties....I had a business visa and could not sponsor a nnanny therefore I was left with maids who had company visas and or were illegal or not experienced but immediately looking foir the next jobs. I tested three but found none to satisfactory - my children were 2 and 4 so I kept them home as the fees for school a driver and the time the kids would have to get up were crazy I had a one hour commute each way so my days was wasted driving not with my kids. The nearest park to my home could be reached by car only; and the traffic sometimes made it a two hour exercise just in driving. The hospitals were OK but the public ones were accessible for appointments during work hours and the private ones expensive. I had a contract that allowed no unpaid leave and had penalties for missed work even if your kids were sick. Needless to say when my husabnd wanted to return home and resume his work and I had been unable to hire help and my son had an epileptic seizure - i gave notice and came home. As an expatriate worker with family I have found much friendly countries to work in where larger percentages of your pay stay with you and are not absorbed by high rents school fees and food prices. You need a good salary if you want to do all you want. in your contract get a vila provided and education for kids and a vihicle rent allowance and you can have an OK expat lifestyle. It depends on your salary - a labourer might be conned into coming for 280 Riyal a month - god knows how they survive. I got 14;000 + and I decided I was better taking 40;000 aud per annum salary cut and working somewhere costs were cheaper and lifestyle more family friendly I still don't have a job but I am very happy with my decision to prioritse my kids and leave Qatar for the Qataris- mostly I found people with families where the women or both parents worked less then satisfied with the cost access to care and quality of care for their kids - People on huge salaries who can afford to join the intercontinental beach club and the wife and kids spent every after schoool moment there seemed satisfied - live in a compound with play facilities and you may be OK . Good luck.	1

You just go down to immigration in Al gharaffa or the airport office with your ID and your sons Id and passport and ask for a multiple exit permit for 1 year.

My advise is to get a multi exit permit; which cost you only QAR 500; but saves you a ton of headache. No need for any form to fill; just take your son's passport; your ID; and go to the airport immigration dept; and make sure to clearly ask for multiple-exit permit option to the person processing your request.	1

how to find them ?	can any body tell me where all the qatar living members meet on holidays .	Ql members are easily identifiable in a crowd. Just watch out for the following characteristics. a) The males will have long flowing beard (Look at my avatar for an idea about how it would look); which will be always unkempt and unruly. If there is a bird which has nested in his beard; that means he is the most senior among them and also the wisest. I tried to make a nest in my beard and invite a bird in; but none would touch it. I wonder why? b) b) The females will almost always have flowing; shiny; silver hair and they will have eyes lined in VIBGYOR – all colours of the rainbow. The more colours they have around their eyes; the more senior in QL they are. Age does not come in here. All of them are very young and nubile. Its very easy to find them in a crowded place because if two QL ladies get together; they will start singing “my heart will go on” at the top of their voices. c) HABITAT They are usually found near beaches and shopping malls where they go away for their hunting.....	1

how to find them ?	can any body tell me where all the qatar living members meet on holidays .	The other day; i met one of the most senior members of QL - Darude. Each time he shook hands with a person; two birds came out through the two sides of his beard singing "cuckoo; cuckoo". I envied him. I didnt have even ONE bird in my beard while he had two. I also saw a few bisuit crumbs on his beard. I have a strong suspicion that he is using Britania bisuits to lure the birds into his beard. I have made a proposal to the birds saying that i would give them swiss chocolate biscuits if they relocated. Lets see how the negotiations go. Will have to stamp their RP's very soon so that they dont leave me anytime soon. Note to self: Give birds Residence permit; land cruiser allowance; two way tickets (even if they can fly on their own) and a free hand in doing what they will with their nest s; provided it will ALWAYS remain within MY beard!	0

Hi QLers.	hv anyone tried sushi in La Cigale Sushi's bar ... i been 3 times so far and very happy with it. It is pricey but to us worth the money.

Well pitstop I don't mean to offend you or the chef. I am sure there has to be more then one person working on the sushi. Maybe I just got the wrong one. Novita I will try la cigele's.

I have seen a restaurant which will serve susjhi; is opening near crepaway at Ramada Corner but are there any places currently serving sushi?	Hi QLers.	As I mentioned above maybe I was expecting sth different. All I know about Japanese culture was from movies. And if you do not try to make a lil search and try to know about a new culture -like me-; you can feel disappointment sometimes. For example I am feeling admire for Japanese people because they are almost the leader of Robotic technology; and for electronics they are also on the tops. But sometimes when I experience that it is very hard for some people to understand sth simple you are disappointed. In any case I admire Japanese people because they could build a strong and developed country after such a massive destruction at WWII while keeping their own traditions. And if we return to our original theme I love Sushi too. Am glad that they are so good at it ;)	0

Truth real estate should be called Lies real estate. I've started dealing with them and they seem quite bad. Before I moved in; they promised the rent included cleaning; but I've found it doesn't. I've given them cheques but it's taking a long time to get a lease. You definitely can't trust these people. I suggest you don't pay the agents commission until you get the lease in your hands and I would suggest you don't move out until you get your deposit back.	1

Where is the best place in Doha to enrol for such activities? Any idea of the fee?	Hi all; I would like to learn sailing and do some watersports like kayaking and jet sky.	To my understanding there is a Sailing club in the Ritz-Carlton/ Diplomatic club area. You might want to try it in there. As per Jetskiing may be go aside to Intercon and there you can rent a jetski either for 1/2 hr or 1 hr and have some fun. Best of luck....regards	1
Where is the best place in Doha to enrol for such activities? Any idea of the fee?	Hi all; I would like to learn sailing and do some watersports like kayaking and jet sky.	When I visited Doha I've been at the Sailing Club and it is really cheap compared to European costs. For about 2000 QR per year you can access to the Club and use the Lasers and 470 boats. I suppose they can offer also lessons; but with the quite wind that blow in Doha it is really easy to learn. Actually I hate the noisy and polluted jet sky; so my suggestion is lear to sail and you will never live without. Cheers from Italy!	1

Where is the best place in Doha to enrol for such activities? Any idea of the fee?	Hi all; I would like to learn sailing and do some watersports like kayaking and jet sky.	The Doha Sailing club is located when you come from the Mariott back to Doha; it is the first gate on your right on the mainroad; immediately after the Mariott roundabout. Go down to the clubhouse & inquire there. (Big parking in front)	1

Does anybody know of the location? 	I keep hearing that there is a Harley Davidson store somewhere in Doha; but no hotel concierge or any cab driver seems to know where it is.	Yes there is one the last i remember it was right next to the airport i hope they didnt close it down after creating the new traffic signal. Basically tell the cab driver or limo driver to take you to the airport traffic lights there are only one you cant go wrong. If when you reach the traffic lights the airport is infront of you then you have come from the Ramada/Hilal direction and the Harley store will be directly to your left while you are stopped at the signal you will see the sign and the bikes inside. If however the driver takes the Corneesh road by the sea towards the airport then when you reach the airport traffic light the airport will be to your left. So you tell the driver to turn right on the traffic light like he is going towards the Mall; and you will see the harley store on your right as soon as you turn right on the traffc light. It is right next to two cargo shipping companies one of them called Ali-Bin-Ali. So its in between the airport traffic lights and the Mall R.....	1

Does anybody know of the location? 	I keep hearing that there is a Harley Davidson store somewhere in Doha; but no hotel concierge or any cab driver seems to know where it is.	The have moved to a new location. The local GT (newspaper) last week had a map with the new location. Now it is located in Al Wakra and Naser Bin Khalid is the dealer; I'm not sure about souvenirs. Also there was a write up on the HD owners club in Doha many months ago in GT.	1
Does anybody know of the location? 	I keep hearing that there is a Harley Davidson store somewhere in Doha; but no hotel concierge or any cab driver seems to know where it is.	I did just now read that there was a new location in Al Wakrah. I was not aware that the Doha store moved. I have been looking for the map you mentioned; but can't find it. Does anyone know how to get to the new store from Doha? or at least to the general area? thanks for all your help!	1
Does anybody know of the location? 	I keep hearing that there is a Harley Davidson store somewhere in Doha; but no hotel concierge or any cab driver seems to know where it is.	The shop by the airport is indeed still open and doing business (yep they still sell bikes and souvenirs). The Al Wakra store is easy to get to; at the airport lights (heading to the airport from the D ring) turn right and keep going; you will reach Al Wakra withing 10-15 minutes dependant on traffic and how heavy your right foot is. On the left hand side of the second roundabout (the one with fountain and clam shaped thing) you will find the new HD shop; also a Kawasaki shop. You're born; you take s**t. You get out in the world; you take more s**t. You climb a little higher; you take less s**t. Till one day you're up in the rarefied atmosphere and you've forgotten what s**t even looks like.

Is there anyone here have similiar position or know how much they are offering?	Hi have been called in for an interview for a position of aircraft engineer in Qatar Airways.	It's depend on the job grade; usually they offered cheap package as compare with other industries or companies in Qatar. They offered me for Technical operation staff.. but people in QL advised me its a very less package to service in Qatar. Keep all the things in mind and than accept the offer bcz accommodation is the biggest problem in Qatar. But there is no harm to attend the interview; it will be a short trip for you. They will call you for interview in Doha; will take care of your food + hotel + air tickets etc. Enjoy your trip and Best of luck!!	0
Is there anyone here have similiar position or know how much they are offering?	Hi have been called in for an interview for a position of aircraft engineer in Qatar Airways.	Technical Staff (Engineer & Mech only (support staff not included)) basic salary has recently been revised and additionally; accommodation allowance is under review and expected to be revised by the end of month. Package offered to you would be based on EN02 grade which is among the best in middleast; anybody who says otherwise is not fully aware of ENG package (Support staff package is crappy). Slight variation would be based on your approvals; more you have more you earn. You will make good money on side because of overtime. Beast666	1

QL will lose it's basic purpose I guess. In About QL they mention "Participation is at the heart of our web site. We believe that collectively our members have more knowledge about life in Qatar than any one person or guidebook. We want to provide a platform for them to share their knowledge and experiences and help newcomers adapt easily to life in Qatar." Nobody shares knowledge or experiences or tries to help others in a chat room; it will just become a place for guys trying to pick up girls. There will not be any participation from all the members on any issue; people will be too busy chatting in private. That's what I personally think anyway. "Live with passion; Die with style"	1

I heard about the demolition of the souks in Doha; was very sad to hear that:( Any idea where the irani souk is shifted to? or anyother souk?	Hello people!	There are Souqs all over Doha - Souq al Ali; Souq Asiri; Furniture Souq; Omani Souq.... I think you have your wires crossed and you are thinking of Souq Al Ahmed.  The tenants were forcibly removed from this souq a while back and it has sit empty for a while in preparation of its demolition.  I for one am glad to see it go - it was ugly as sin and now they can further extend Souq Waqif right to Hamad street.	1

Any recommendations?	I have been here since November and not managed to get a decent haircut yet!	Four Seasons do mens hair on Sundays. There's also one in Salam shopping mall. I think the Sheraton have one also. Beverly Hills Tower have one but he's on holiday at the moment.	1
Any recommendations?	I have been here since November and not managed to get a decent haircut yet!	There's a place called Ras Beirut in Al-Sadd; near Marmara Istanbul... Cool place; ask for Mu'taz!	1
Any recommendations?	I have been here since November and not managed to get a decent haircut yet!	How much do those hair cuts at the Four Seasons; the Landmark and the Villaggio cost?

Any recommendations?	I have been here since November and not managed to get a decent haircut yet!	Some little barber shops dotted around Al-Sadd; cheap and they will give you lots of attention; haircut; shave and sometiimes pull your fingers till they crack.   I go to this place and they switch the tv to the english tv for me to watch and sometimes shout for a tea.   True the haircut might not be great or good but its a fun little adventure and much more exciting than going to the fancy hotels barbers; plus it supports my local businesses of Al-Sadd. Qatars best known Pirate - Yaarr!	1
Any recommendations?	I have been here since November and not managed to get a decent haircut yet!	Mohammed Sagheer salon at Sharq resort(I think its 100 per cut) and the one at Beverly Hills tower (much cheaper) I think the barber there is back from his holiday. You can call him and ask- 6645481.	1
Any recommendations?	I have been here since November and not managed to get a decent haircut yet!	Hi; thanks for all the ideas of where to have my next haircut! If won't be at Patrice! I went to Patrice at Villaggio and was deeply disappointed. They charged QAR 75. The price wasn't what I was after; I just wanted a decent cut! I'd call my session there HAIRCHOP! The guy who did my hair was not involved for a more than a minute trying to find out what I wanted and this is the worst cut I had since my mother did a "pot cut" for me when I was 5 or 6 years old. The Filipino hair dressers carried on a loud conversation between themselves discussing their personal problems; living arrangements etc. 	0

No forget Karwa... those people r dumb. Just go to any rent a car and rent it from them. U can get a bus for around 1200 or 1500 a day.  When  I was working at Al Sulaiman Rent a car in 2004; the prices were 800. But i am not really sure if its around 1200 - 1500. Better to check. Even  Al Muftah rent a car gives buses for rent.  It's always the small things that make big differences.	1
Where can I rent a bus? 	I'm organizing a one day trip in Qatar for friends. I need a bus to travel with them. Toyota Coaster is a nice-sized bus.	I've PM'ed Frog.  Is Rayyx the company that rents out the yellow buses?  How can I contact them?  Are they pretty clean and smell nice?  I'm taking around some people who would expect to be driving in pretty nice (like a Toyota Coaster). I've contacted a few bus rental places (Thrifty; al-Muftah) and their prices are around QR750.  Is it possible just to hire a private guy who drives a bus around?  Giving him a reasonable per hourly wage; QR400 should be enough.	0

QR is such a huge company that your application will not always get notcied by applying online. I suggest calling the recruitment department and speaking to the person in charge of the position (department) you are applying for. Otherwise you might be waiting forever. This worked for me.	1

I really need your advices. I'll be thankful.	I was a student at Cambridge until 2009 and dunno how the situation is now but I can honestly say it was one of the worst schools at that time The student behavior is horrible. So horrible that they had to bring in like 10 security guards and put in cameras all over the school The teachers were mostly indian with a couple of english in high ranking positions but head of security(an arabic lady) was basically ruling the school.Even the teachers were scared of her. This is obviously a students perspective from two years ago so dont take it too seriously If i had to list all it's faults the character limit will be passed	1

I used to be an electrician in my visa as we dont have a visa for professionals way back in 2005. now it was stamped according to what I do now in our company. It took them 2 weeks ot process it; They submitted my authenticated Diploma and NOC from my employer. " Fascinated with Supercars but can’t afford it yet; so I settle down for a humble Jeepney.

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	0

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

Of course it is azilana; change in weight = calories consumed - calories burnt So if you eat more than you use; you gain weight. If you eat less than you use; you lose weight. Magic!	1
any one would like to share his/her experience?	I don't believe that i lost 5 kg in 10 days.. by simply just counting calories and walking for 30 minutes everyday.	Bleu is right. The initial weight loss is water weight then the rest is a little tougher to lose. It is really that simple: Eat less and exercise more. ;) It is so easy; it's hard!	1

I've been so stressed over my dog being sick that I've lost 5 pounds in 5 days... Yep counting calories and exercise works; but...what you ladies have to remember is that men lose weight faster and easier than women do. Its the estrogen in our bodies that fight the weight loss. God made it so that we would always have that extra reserve in case there was a time of starvation or deprivation; so that we could maintain our bodies to have babies... If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous; he will not bite you; that is the main difference between a dog and man. -Mark Twain-	1

You just go down to immigration in Al gharaffa or the airport office with your ID and your sons Id and passport and ask for a multiple exit permit for 1 year.

My advise is to get a multi exit permit; which cost you only QAR 500; but saves you a ton of headache. No need for any form to fill; just take your son's passport; your ID; and go to the airport immigration dept; and make sure to clearly ask for multiple-exit permit option to the person processing your request.	1

The revised answer was something like; "My friends an I know where the Unites States of America is on the world map. But if the statistics are indeed correct then more emphasis should be laid at Geography in schools to correct the situation" or something like that.

You have to take your own decision. The good part is that there are several options. Take your car to couple of garrages mentioned above. Talk to them; ask the cost; time they will take to fix; parts cost; labor cost; etc. then; make your own judgement. All the best.	0

Can anyone please help me - I have been offered a total all inclusive monthly salary of QR 25000 per month with aingle status visa. Can anybody guide me whether I should accept this offer if I have to bring my wife and one school going kid ?	For medical facilities Government health card will be provided. My present salary in India is Rs12.93 lacs per annum.The contract does not specify any minimum or maximum time period.	At begining it is OK; come out ; see the world; working at international stage is itself an achievement. You would be able to save 2 lacs / annum; provided you don't listen to your european colleagues who have extremely unjustified higher salaries than others !	0
Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids. The sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee's bank account.	There was a meeting held at Philippine embassy last week and they tackled about this matter. One of the requirements in submitting agreements in embassy is Labor contract signed by the sponsor indicating the salary of $400. We are still waiting for the confirmation of the additional requirement. Once the labor contract will be attached to the housemaid's agreement; the indicated salary will be implemented.	1

Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids. The sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee's bank account.	When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250. In the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid sends home 95 % of her salary - I remit it myself to her mothers account. She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home	0

Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car.	Even if you have a International License; you need to get a temporary license from Traffic Department. When you are in Doha; get the application for temporary license and submit it to the Madinat Khalifa Traffic Department along with copy of your US license and passport pages showing your identity and visa page You might need to get an NOC from the sponsor (Typed in Arabic) if you visit here under visa from some company or sponsor. Best way is to ask the rental car company to assist you to get it.	1

Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car.	Supposedly the US license is good for (7) days.

I recommend that you go to a AAA agency and get an international license. Driving here in Doha is pretty dangerous- so I recommend you take every measure to protect yourself. It is pretty easy and not costly. See you when you get here!	1

Is it legal to drive using USA Driver License or do I need and international one?	I visiting Doha for a week and intend to rent a car.	Sorry for my earlier post. I didn’t completely check the week’s issue. Actually my rental car company asked me to do all those formalities when I come to Qatar for 1st time even after I was having UAE license and International one from UAE during business visit of 2 months. As per bellow article its 15days after you enter. http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&item_no=189106&version=1&template_id=36&parent_id=16	0
Do you think it is right? if YES/NO then why?	Iam here in qatar for about 6 &1/2 years. Many people have said to me that they are happy about the Qatari youngsters attitiude towards the women because these guys are not starring at our wives & daughters in a bad sense like we experience in our countries.	Yes it is right. Qataris are interested in Arabic ladies or any lady exposing her body openly. . I have seen them following only ARABIC LADIES. They just stare at western Ladies.	1

Depends what you consider "a bad sense". While a lot of religion's claim that lust is some sort of a sin; without it the human race would be in dire trouble as no one would procreate. People lust after people they perceive as fertile and viable for successful procreation; it's actually a biological form of flattery.	0

Can anyone recommend a powerful router that is easy to setup and can be found in Qatar?	We cannot reach the internet from all the rooms in our house.

I am thinking to replace the Qtel provided router (Thomson) with a more powerful one. We also have Mozaic subscription.	The best long range router is undoubtedly a wireless N router and i.e D-Link DIR-825/N or Linksys WRT54GL or WRT54G;( thanks2 Bluepanther for sugg) you can do some twiks and try if it works; in most cases it works. - Open the router's administration tool & log on and make below changes - Update the MAC address of the router (i prefer using MAc address) - Set the channel range upto 11 - Secure your router and ensure that you use wireless encryption and/or MAC filtering and check it Beside you can place a router after configuring with Wi-Fi tools where you get more signal. Try - inSSIDer 2 wifi tool (open source software) and track the chance. Good Luck !	1

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....	1

Pickpockets are few and far between and you can easily go out at night without worries. The only issue is being overcharged. This is more rampant in Egypt than Turkey. Then again; Egypt is a cheaper location overall. 4. Which one is easier for visa on arrival for Indians? I don't have an answer for this one. I'd check with their embassies. 5.

The visa probably will be single entry; and your company must apply for a visit visa again while she or you are in turkey-egypt. I think with a minimum of three business day. I check last week the tickets to Cairo and QA have only one flight a day and the hours are not the best. I recommend you to check.

Two days ago I found out that the car I am using has been fined QR 300 and 3 points. But on this day my car was unmoved from the place car being parked in our building.	Dont panic !Go to Madina Khalifa traffic dept and ask for eveidence of Traffic vilation they will provide you the copy of the picture taken by the radar or if manual it will have the details of the place where violation done with the detail of the officer who booked it simple just check it to make sure than if not your car argue your case .Good Luck	1

Try to recollect the events and your standard practice of driving in the past few days that some traffic police man is hiding such a way that u would have not noticed and they will take note of irregularities such as speaking in mobiles; non tightning seatbelts;such and such is like that and will be recorded in their system and message may be automated subsequently to appear in ur mobile on this particular day. If u are very much sure; just try madeenat khalifa and ask for evidences convincing the situation as you believe now that you have not moved out the car on this particular day. Good luck	1

planned for Edi Ul-Fitru?	Are there any fireworks e.t.c.	well; we don't celebrate Eid Al-Fitr the same way u celebrate Christmas; so you won't find fireworks in most countries. mostly it's about family gathering; having lunch together; and going out in groups I guess. As for Doha; it's gonna be my first Eid here; so I'll just wait and see how it will be... :)	1

If your comment is based on what I have posted; please do not get me wrong; I do not know if they will have fireworks or not; it is just that these fireworks are arranged by the govt. and what appeared in the papers was that this time the govt has not arranged any festivites for this eid due to the run up to the asian games.	0

Are there any Qatar Airways expat crew out there willing to share sum tips or experiences about working with Qatar Airways?	Hi all! I&#39;m a newbie here- a Malaysian guy in aviation and SERIOUSLY considering a career with Qatar Airways. I am an experienced cabin crew.	Cactiflora... if you want my advice; try etihad airlines of the UAE. They are newer and you have much more opportunities. If you are experienced you will make cabin manager within a couple of years. Its true that QR pay a little more than etihad but etihad just recently raised their duty allowance to abou US$150 per day. You are also given the option of taking cash instead of accommodation and transport. But the overriding factor; in my opinion; is that QR is awful when it comes to customer service and this reputation is spreading.	1

Are there any Qatar Airways expat crew out there willing to share sum tips or experiences about working with Qatar Airways?	Hi all! I&#39;m a newbie here- a Malaysian guy in aviation and SERIOUSLY considering a career with Qatar Airways. I am an experienced cabin crew.	Qatar Airways is the worst airline I have ever flown on. Always at least a 2 hour delay; the stewards are useless; and they think that just because they give you fancy food and a tv in the seat it will make up for the general rudness of the airline crew and the fact that you are running 2 hours late.	1

I&#39;m a newbie here- a Malaysian guy in aviation and SERIOUSLY considering a career with Qatar Airways. I am an experienced cabin crew.	One of the worst international airlines in the world; in my opinion; for customer care. I think they were voted best airline by business travellers; not the general public. In business or first; your treated like royalty because thats where airline industry votes usually come from. But fly in cattle class and its a different story. I think the strategists for this airline should be told what a poor service they are providing to the general flying public. Only reason they are popular is because they are cheap (for economy) and they have a virtual monopoly on doha airport.	1

Are there any Qatar Airways expat crew out there willing to share sum tips or experiences about working with Qatar Airways?	Hi all! I&#39;m a newbie here- a Malaysian guy in aviation and SERIOUSLY considering a career with Qatar Airways. I am an experienced cabin crew.	QA flies non stop from Doha to more destinations then any other airline. Skytrax has voted QA cabin attendants best in middle east and 2nd best in the world. It is a comparatively young airline; mistakes are made in process but comfort of non stop travel and frequency that QA has is a great service for residents of Qatar. I was flying with BA on a 8 hr transatlantic flight and I had made special request for food (they were advised week in advance) but guess what no food; had to eat peanuts for more then 8 hours.. Does that mean BA is a bad airline; no its not but these things happens. All airlines have issues with delays and all are working hard to minimize them; QA has better on time performance than many big name airlines. I hope your next flight with QA is on time; if not then call airliner (Qatarliving Member) he works for QA I think Beast666	1

Yes you need something with a close sea view. You should try al Sharq. I think it is very romantic. They give you those rooms like little homes; nice sea view and great pools.. If you want to party; it is not the place. W is my fav in terms of service; but it does not fall under the romantic category. 4 seasons sucks. Looks good from far but is far from good. Grand Hayat is OK; it's got a bit of everything you might need. I'd still go to Sharq if I am to impress someone and be super romantic tho.	1

Why out of ALL nationalities the exception would be made only for UK? Citizens of 34 western countries can obtain a visa upon arrival; without prior application; but more or less the same rule applies to the entire world; not only in Qatar. ravi.shock; in order to obtain a visit visa (only Single entry; like everyone!); you have to have relatives here; who can sponsor you.

I went for the first time to Ezdan today and what a complete and utter piece of trash it is. The finishings in Tower 3 were atrocious. How could the builder let this happen? The building is relatively new and already broken tiles; filthy cielings and walls. The wall tiles are still filthy from the worthless masoners who installed them. Typical old Doha masonry. Paint around the light switches; paint on the trim; careless finishing throughout. PLASTIC MOLD DOORS?!?! How cheap can they be?? Seriously I would not pay 2000 QR a month for any these crap dwellings. Filthy windows; CHEAP CHEAPO CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP a thousand times over. All this and I can believe people actually live in this skunkhole. TRASH TOP TO BOTTOM. I have seen better in the older buildings near Musheirib	1

Furniture is not brand new; but at least comfortable and clean. Lighting is dull in the appartments... Kitchen is too tiny...Windows are small and dirty; but now they started to clean them. To cover all these negative points they provide the best gym and swimming pool in Doha; free of charge for tenants. Free cabel and Internet; free shuttle bus from your Tower to City Center; so you don't have to spend hours trying to find parking there. Housekeeping 2 times per week; full maintenance service. Small cafe in the Towers - you can enjoy a fresh coffee in the mornings; the sea food restaurant...Small play area for kids with slides and swings. All this is very helpful for the family with kids - especially housekeeping:)! Pesonnel is friendly and professional.	1

I've heard some crap about 1 and 2 but 4 is cool. The only pain I've had is that they insist on doing one of the 2 cleanings per week on a friday morning. I mean.. really.... most people are trying to sleep.... I would think it would make sense to do it during the week. I have a 1 bedroom (livingroom; kitchen; bedroom and 2 bath) on a 2 month contract. Honestly; I think its overpriced (and Im only on the 6th floor). But other than that... its pretty decent.	1

Dear QL members; It is very surprising that HSBC is still not reducing their personal loan interest rate while othe banks have been implementing 5.0% +1.5% loan policy as per Qatar Central Banks regulations.	We'll see if they are true to their words once I check the amount that they will deduct from my salary this coming salary...	0

Dear QL members; It is very surprising that HSBC is still not reducing their personal loan interest rate while othe banks have been implementing 5.0% +1.5% loan policy as per Qatar Central Banks regulations.	for banks to reduce their interest rates per QCB's circular. No ifs or buts. The QCB is the governing body of banks. Wikipedia: "...The primary function of a central bank is to provide the nation's money supply; but more active duties include controlling interest rates (i.e.; price fixing ); and acting as a lender of last resort to the banking sector during times of financial crisis (e.g.; bailouts ). It may also have supervisory powers; intended to prevent banks and other financial institutions from reckless or fraudulent behaviour. Central banks in most developed nations are independent in that they operate under rules designed to render them free from political interference." If your bank has not reduced its interest rates; then they fall under 'fraudalent behaviour'; which would make them liable.	0

In my opinion..hsbc have lots of hidden charges..even if you go to customer service..they could not even show or explain how they calculate their interest in front of you..they only know how and when to deduct money from your salary..

Yes!!! There was a circular was issued 4-months ago. QCB is allowing banks to charge a maximum interest of 5% per annum and it is a retroactive implementation where the loan shall be re-calculated front and back. Was planning to pay my remaining loan and I learned to know that their computation will be based on the original interest rate when loan was taken. In fact; loan agreement is based on floating rate. This new interest rate are now being implemented by other banks; except HSBC>>>>>	1

"If the PLUS or Cirrus logo is not visible on your card; then it is advisable to check with your card issuing institution before using it in an overseas cash machine. "LINK is not able to advise about the location of overseas ATMs or about the level of charges which may be applied by the ATM owner." A LINK-enabled card which displays the PLUS (VISA) and/or Cirrus (Mastercard) brand logos can usually be used in an overseas ATM which also displays these logos. However; not all LINK Members take advantage of this international connection facility and so it all depends upon the bank; building society or other card company that issued your card; if the PLUS or Cirrus logo is not visible on your card then it is advisable to check with your card issuing institution before using it in an overseas cash machine.

Hmm.. but neither VISA nor Mastercard; nor my QNB debit cards worked. AFAIK; VISA and Master use different networks. I tried it in all ATMs; even Citibank (which usually works everywhere). And of course QNB denies everything. Only this particular bank in this particular country. Elsewhere; from Brazil to Switzerland no problems with QNB cards at all.

Must be the group or bank; who is or sponsoring the QNB card. Not necesserarily is your bank; is the institution where the alliance for the visa is coming from. It just pop in my mind; Maybe your bank just have the card block; and they need to lift it. That is just another option. One time in Kenya ; my bank block it; because they tought soemone stole it. Neverless to say their security measures are tedious and painfull; but is about customer protection. I did call them and they lift the ban right away. Cardinal OF QATAR LIVING	1

Just to clarify what I want to find out: Can I and my unmarried girlfriend (who does not have the same family name as me) check in to a hotel and share the same room? And I don't want to go to Spain or Italy. The reason I am looking at Qatar is also that it's approx 6 hours non-stop flying time from BKK and from where I am right now. If she were to visit me or I go to BKK it would take most of a day each way and we only have 4-5 days to spend.	0

If you were both white European/Westerners; you probably wouldn't be asked. However; your GF is from Asia and she will attract attention simply because a large number of prostitutes in Qatar are of that ethnicity. There is no guarantee you'd be prevented from staying but there's no guarantee you won't Hotels do keep track of who is checking in with who and may even question ladies who are going up to rooms. I have experienced this myself in a 5* hotel where the hotel had a staff member stationed at the elevators. Might you get away with it? Possibly.	1

Does anyone know of venues for a kiddie party? How about a restaurant or a place where we can rent & have the food catered? 	Mcdo & KFC are already given.	Most of the play areas (Jungle Zone; Extreme world; Rays Reef) will do parties and I think you can specify food arrangements although most use the FF outlets. Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment. Hope this helps.	1

Expats applying for residency in the UAE will be tested on their knowledge of local cultures and traditions; the Federal National Council said on Monday; adding further hurdles for foreigners planning to work in the oil-rich nation. "Too many people don't know anything about our culture - there are many nationalities - and every resident needs to know something about this country;" Ahmed Shabeeb al-Dhahiri; first deputy speaker of the Federal National Council; told UAE daily Khaleej Times. Expatriates account for more than 80 percent of the population of the UAE; which relies on foreign workers to fuel its economy. But the number of expats is predicted to decrease as people working in construction and real estate lose their jobs and return home. Dhanin said a committee; which will be made up of members of various ministries; would be set up by October to create strategies to improve expats' understanding of the country; the newspaper reported on Tuesday. He said the series of questions.....	1

I am An HR Manager; Since You Have not yet printed your visa; you have to leave the country and they new company will recruit you on a new visa (NO NOC Required). But do not make finger print; since they can make a RP for you. but what you are doing is a horrible thing since the company brought you from your country on their own expense and then you decided that you want to find another job (which is relatively easy here). Well its none of my business; but good luck	1

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	1

What is acceptable?"	My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told "long sleeves and long skirts". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro.....	1

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..	1

Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear "normal" clothes; this is totally acceptable for "western ladies". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela	1

Can someone give me some pointers on What can be purchased in Qatar.	Hi; I will be travelling to Qatar in the first quarter of 2009. I heard that Gold and other electronics goods are cheaper in Qatar when compared to other countries. Could you suggest me the things which are cheap in Qatar and reasonably high in India. I also heard that Gold is one among them.	Gold is the same price the world around. The only difference is the "making charge" and tax for some countries such as Egypt. Dubai probably has the least extra price on top of the gold's value for that day. If you don't know the day's price for; say; 22k gold; don't try to buy some. The merchant will have you figured out in a flash. Mandi	1

Do you know of any?	Hi We are coming to Doha end of December and looking for a short term accomodation on monthly basis until we find long term villa. We need to be close to the Education City.	Never tell conartists (housing agents) your budget for a Villa! They will show you something worth 10;000 QAR and tell you it's worth 15;000! Check online for aparthotels which rent out apartments on weekly / monthly basis. And another thing - it is illegal for agents to charge you sometimes as much as a months' comission for showing you Villas. They get their commission from the landlord but many still try and 'con' the prospective tenant. Just a bit of advise - good luck!	0

I know it is on the road; after Marriott and Qatar Aviation college. But not sure about the route to reach the Offices of THALES and GULF HELICOPTERS.	It's the first right turn (slip road) after ras abou aboud bridge. You have to drive quite a bit to get there. Use the link below. The map cross-hairs are on the turn off from main road. http://wikimapia.org/#lat=25.2832421&lon=51.5579742&z=16&l=0&m=b Get there really early (before 5:30am; regardless of your flight time) if you want to have any chance of finding a parking spot.	1
Does any body has any suggestion of how to do this change?	My profession shown in my residence visa is Technician whereas in reality I am working as Manager.

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	0

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.	0
I would appreciate feedback from anyone who has actually invested / or planning to invest in this project... Whats the flip side/ disadvantages of investing in Pearl Qatar.....

Concerns are cost of finance; time to completion; an American attack on Iran; quality of finishings; size of deposit and finally; but far from least; property law and owner's right for foreigners in Qatar.

From what i've read about it; it is considered to be a good investment and definetly the prices will go up; expected around 20% at least within next few years. As for the completion date; i wouldn't worry to much about the delays cause the first towers that were supposed to be there by dec 2007 -will be there. I know a person who bought an apartmant in those first towers. unless something really bad and unexpected happens ; there shouldn't be any worry about your investment in the Pearl.	1

Who asked you to go for an MRI; that doctor can give a referral for hamad hospital; requesting a MRI. Appointment can take upto a month. I don't think it's necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad. I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem. Their staff is usually helpful; sometimes it can take more than 3 staff members to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you.	1

In order to get any service from HMC; you need a Health card. Alongwith the Health card; go with your private Doctor MRI referral to the Main HMC MRI section or Al-rumaila MRI section ang get the appointment. So simple. Best regards.	1

I'm new here so I am not quiet sure who ""my doctor"" is. Otherwise I have to pay around 1000QR at a private hospital; which is very expensive.	Secure a health card if you have not done so already by visiting the Health Center of your area with a pp size photograph and QR 100. (Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....	1

Hi flexicode; you can see a doctor at hamad without going through the health centre. I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.	1

I must add that they keep changing their rules so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt. Moreover getting an MRI done outside could cost almost 1500 or more;depending upon the area being scanned. But it depends on how worried you are about your condition; and the cost is nothing; you get your results quickly; but if you can wait; its better to get into the national health care system; its not costly; and let them take care of you. Hope you feel well soon.	1

Firstly thank you all for the quick and informative responses. Nobody has actually ASKED me to get an MRI; but I want to do it myself as I am worried about my back. My lower back has been aching me for about 2 weeks now; and yesterday the upper right side of my back starting hurting. I visited a Doctor and he instantly told me that it is NOT a slipped disc; and is just a muscle spasm as the pain doesn't extend to my legs; though I still want to be certain as I want to start working out again; but I don't want to mess with my back if I shouldn't. And he said the upper back pain was also normal; and not related to a slipped disc whatsoever. Thanks again!	0

Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after. You can also meet dr.bhat at Doha clinic; he is one of the best and a longtimer in Doha. I would advice you to refrain from weight training.....	1

Hey han19; Thank you so much for the reply; and the advice. I feel so much better knowing that it hopefully most likely is NOT a slipped disc. Being so young; and having started a new career; it would really not be a good thing. I have stopped weight training completely for now which sucks; but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly? You think jogging is okay? I want to meet a proper Doctor; even if at a private hospital; as the guy at Hamad was busy; and only barely gave me any advice. I am sure a proper doctor can give me advice as to how exactly the right position is to sleep; to sit; etc. Maybe can give me some exercises to do to help me recover faster. You know any Doctor; even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend? These problems are to do with the Radiology section is that right? Forgive me as I know VERY little about hospitals and such problems; as I have had very few problems in the past (touch wood). Thank you again	0

Hi Hmd; I would not advice you to do any strength training till you back pain subsides. Are you a heavy person. Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....	0
Also; is the family status possible with this salary and what is the minimum salary for family status?	My husband got an offer from a Qatar Construction company with a salary of 2500 QAR + Accomodation. Please let me know it is a good offer or not.	What is his job & position he received this offer then we can comment. But still you ask about the family living in Qatar I will tell you some facts. As per the present rule your salary should be more than 7000 QR. then only you can apply for family visa. If you want to hire a single bedroom appartment in Qatar you have to pay minimum 5000 QR. Living expenses for a bachelor will be minimum 700/800 QR. per month (I think); then family you can imagine. Qatar is very expensive. Before going to accept any offer from here please re-think twice. Is that suitable for you? Or consult with any friends or relatives living in Qatar. All the best.	1

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'.

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0
This means I'll need to terminate the kahramaa contract for the old apartment and start a new one; is this something you can do in a single step process? If you have done this before; what is the best way of doing it?	I am in the process of shifting between two apartments from two different landlords.	I dont think it is a single step process. Your new apartment will have a meter and a number given by Kahrmaa. you will need to have that no when u go to Kahrmaa and also the receipt which was given to you when you paid the adv for the current house. You will ofcourse have to fill out the transfer form and they will make the transfer. But you need to let them know when you are shifting so that they can give you the connection before you shift. I guess thats about it. its all i did when i shifted but that was in 2006. i doubt if much has changed but here you never know. also have copies of your rp; passport and id and a fotograph just in case and a copy of your new lease agreement.	1

Went to the Musheireb branch at 6:45am; a gentleman took all my paperwork including pictures of the old apartment's readings; so no need to call for a technician! They made an estimation for the final settlement; got reimbursed with the difference and then had to reopen a new account and paid a new deposit of 2100 QR. It was very easy; all thanks to Mr. Hamad from the main counter.	0

Medical treatment is OK; but surgical treatment should be taken only if it's life threatening emergency.	0

Do Brits face a similiar dilemma?	Went to Madinat Kalifa to convert my american driving license. The rules were changed in May 2009; I have no idea why. Americans will have to take the tests before a license is issued.	if you live in most of the larger cities in America; the driving is pretty much the same as in Doha. The driving style is very aggressive. If would make more sense if ALL people had to take the driver's test; especially if they are from a country that drives on the opposite side of the road as that can be a major issue;especially when you are faced with people flying up behind you with their lights flashing and pushing you out of the way!! What WOULD make the most sense if if someone causes some of those horrible accidents or people who are caught driving like maniacs; regardless of what nationality they are (even Qatari!) are forced to take the driving classes and tests all over again beore being allowed to drive again on Qatar roads. Might just reduce the amount of accidents if there was some punishment involved; instead of just paying a fine and losing points.

Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled.	6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However; the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4; any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However; this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior; or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor; according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

Is it worth the hassle of customs or should i buy new? How do prices compare UK Next with Qatar Next?	I begin employment in Qatar Aug 09 and have just been quoted 1000 to have them flown over.	since u specifically about NEXT then the prices r the same...except that here u dont get EVERYTHING u find over in the UK but we do have most of the British stores.We have Debanhams;M&S;BHS and Next.But over all 1000 is way to much to pay....depending on how much clothes you have .....or need...i would humbly suggest that u evaluate yr clothes because u know the prices; u alone will be able to judge if the money will buy u what u decide to leave behind...

Is it worth the hassle of customs or should i buy new? How do prices compare UK Next with Qatar Next?	I begin employment in Qatar Aug 09 and have just been quoted 1000 to have them flown over.	I would just want to reiterate that prices are MUCH higher here. For example yesterday in M&S looked at a pair of trousers; UK price 29.50; Qatar price 200QR; which means about 38 sterling at the current rates. Next I have found to be even worse than this. At another shop bought my son some Clarks sandles costing 245QR which would have been 30 in the UK. Talk about mark up ! I would also say that the range of clothing to the average UK taste is quite limited. As soon as you go outside of the UK shops you can run into some rather ornate clothing. The quality can be questionable aswell. Not sure how the higher end international shops compare. I am currently counting down the days til I go back to the UK in the summer and hit the summer sales ! Planning on going with empty cases and coming back with rather full ones LOL.	1

What is you opinion of Deducting that amount from Account without any notification?

You should negotiate on the part where the company provide insurance for the entire family. No logic in them providing insurance just for you. Second; do negotiate the car allowance coz if you plan to rent a car; a good vehicle; say a honda civic would cost you qrs. 2500. a 4WD would cost you much more. Third; do check where your working base is going to be. Is it in Al Khor? If yes; it is a nice location along with a community where your family will feel at home. I stated Al Khor coz most of the leading big petroleum companies are in the Al Khor side. All the best. Cheerios	1

Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	Dear Olivka; What you have heard is not true regarding the nationality of children at the school which is in Al-Waab near Sports City that has opened only this week. A friend of mine has her children registered there and she tells me that there are hardly any Arab children there. The majority of kids are those of RasGas;Qatar Gas and Qatar Airways employees who are not Qataris or Arabs. I am also told that all the teachers are British and the building is great. From what she told me; if I had kids I would have taken them there.	1
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	It seems to me that there is some confusion. Yes; there are many Qatari children at the D Ring Road branch of Newton International School and there are plenty of them at the West Bay school; as well as quite a few Arab-speaking children who are not from Qatar. However; I am reliably informed that the new Newton British School in Al-Waab does not admit Qataris; although there may be one or two Arab-speaking children who are not Qataris. Like some other schools in Doha; the Newton International School at West Bay and the school at D Ring are supposed to follow the English National Curriculum. However; Islamic Studies and Arabic are definitely not part of the English National Curriculum; but nevertheless these subjects take up a significant slice of the available teaching time. This means that there is less time available for other subjects; such as Maths; Science and English. Another important point to remember is that the school day for many schools in Doha is significantly shorter than.....	1
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	My two sons were in the Newton school last year. Kids are from multi-nationalities I didn't like the school for several reasons. One of them that they don't teach enough Arabic or Islamic studies. Some of the other reasons are as following: Kids were seen unsupevised most of the times some Teachers and people in admition office are not polite. Thy yeal to parents and kids all the time. one of the teacher don't explain any thing in the class he only set on his seat with a labtop to watch football. my son didn't have a math teacher for half a year. they don't have swimming pool as they said when we enroll my sons. ....and many other things. My children now in a different school.	0
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	I've been there and I saw with my own eyes - kids there are almost 97% from Arabic countries. Yes; they have British system but kids on break time speak Arabic... For Muslim parents this school is the best choice - their kids will learn Arabic from their schoolmates very fast and English from the teachers... For the other parents who are not interested in their kids to be fluent in Arabic maybe it's better to find another alternative...For example; schools where kids are from European countries and can learn French; Dutch; or Spanish as second language. The only problem it's hard to get in those schools... The best way to know is not to rely on forum advises but go and see it yourself; isn't it?	0
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	I was at Newton British School with my friend whose kids are studying there yesterday. I am sorry Olivka but you don't know what you are talking about. There are almost zero Arabs in the school and the kids talk in English during their break time because they don't know Arabic; I heard them myself! I am speaking about Newton British School in Al-Waab near Sport City. Sorry Olivka but you are completely wrong and as I have found from the regisrar the children are from the USA; Australia; the UK; Canada; Germany; Japan;New Zealand etc. The school has just opened but have a serious enterance examination. Sorry but 97% of students from Arabic countries does not apply to any school in Qatar that uses English as a medium of education let alone NBS.	1

Wow; that's amazing. Two diametrically opposed eyewitness accounts of a both a school's ethnic make up and the language the children are speaking. Certainly makes me wonder about the validity of observations here on QL. But perhaps what we have here is a "failure to communicate" and there's been a misunderstanding about which branch each of you are speaking of. Mandi	0
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	Let's start again. There are now THREE different branches of Newton. Two are called "Newton International School" and one is called "Newton British School". The two branches of N.I.S. are in West Bay and the other is next to the D Ring Road (aka Al Mamoura). Newton British School is in Al Waab; just round the corner from Villagio. Now the two branches of N.I.S. have a significant number of Qatari children; together with other Arab-speaking children; as well as expat children. The Newton British School does not have any Qatari children (to the best of my knowledge) and only a few Arab-speaking children. The two branches of N.I.S. have Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum; whereas the Newton British School does not. I hope that this clears up any misunderstandings. If you really do not believe me; then perhaps the sensible thing would be for you to go to each one of these schools and see for yourself.

Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	I can agree that the Newton British School has a good mixture of nationalities without any one nationality dominating. They are following the National Curriculum of England and Wales and they have a high pass rate expectation for their entrance tests. People will be very short sighted to write off this school - lovely small classes with friendly staff and good academic levels ... and thats exactly what I want for my children!	0

Do not fall for the negativity on the forum. If you don't like it and can't cope with the social life; you always have the option of resigning.

We Indians have been able to contribute only because we have got slapped in home & school. We are here in GCC as the greatest demand work force in all areas in terms of skills; tolerance; business; management and above all compatability; because we have been slapped. This has given us the name of biggest and trustable employees among all the nationalities & are at par of all as per the GCC nationals say so. I'm proud we are Indians. Don't get dragged away by stupid man made rules when the creator has asked us to teach behaviour whatever way it applies. Kids are very soft and I like them more than you people who look really less matured to pass such comments. We create ourselves above the mighty knowledge of the creators who has many trillions years experience and we not even mature in the age of 40 - 50 years that we survive as adults. Pass comments only when you fell like being knowing more on the subject.	0

I don't think God would love the kids to be slapped. in addition; hitting kids is affecting him/her psychologically and make them lose their self confidence and can suffer from depression. is that what u want for ur kid??? fine; but u slap ur own kid. don't let a stranger slap ur kid for u.	0

Why out of ALL nationalities the exception would be made only for UK? Citizens of 34 western countries can obtain a visa upon arrival; without prior application; but more or less the same rule applies to the entire world; not only in Qatar. ravi.shock; in order to obtain a visit visa (only Single entry; like everyone!); you have to have relatives here; who can sponsor you. They should know the requirements. Otherwise you can apply through the Hotel.	1

I know for a fact there are only 33 countries that can get upon arrival visit visa Americans are one; it is renewal for 1extra month. Then you must leave Qatar and re enter on new visa. I have been here 10 months; there is no multiple entry visa for Qatar. I had to leave 2 times in 6 months for a few hours to Bahrain until my family visit visa was approved for 6 months. Then work visa.	1

Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	It could very well be true. Qatarization is a very high priority here. But with that said; saying that Qataris should fill secretarial positions and getting them to do so are two different things. A national is going to have to want the job before the job is Qatarized. I'm not sure how this would be handled so I don't see it happening overnight. I'm not sure if this refers to replacing people already in positions or for new positions opening up. One would like to think that expats will keep their job until their contract runs out at least. Also - it could be that a qualified Qatari is given first opportunity at a new position and if it isn't filled then it can be opened up to expats. In any event - it will take time to sort out.	0
Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	I can see it happening overnight indeed. In my organization we have four administrative positions sitting empty that have been reserved for Qataris. No one wants them; we had one woman for a while; but she quit after a month as her husband thought that it was too far for her to drive. What silliness; we can't hire anyone to fill the positions as they are reserved for Qataris; but we can't find any Qataris willing to take the jobs; and nothing is getting done. Why are administrative positions considered to be "unskilled" anyway? A good admin assistant is worth their weight in gold.	0
Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	light of the subject but think it is a valid point that gumby made; if there are people willing to do the job; myself included but the positions are empty being reserved for Qatari's it seems so pointless :( please excuse me I am at the moment mesmerised by the above signature!!!! lol	0

Can some one confirm this please ?	I have just been informed by my HR department that all 'secretarial' positions now must be Qatarized.	the "pecking" order for jobs has always been Qatari first; second was other arab and third was any other nationality. Admin jobs (particularly HR) have always been seen as an easy Qatarisation option. It's not like an operational job where; if somebody screws up; there's often a big bang or an accident. HR and its systems can slowly deteriorate with no apparent effect......until the system does collapse and by then it's often too late. Enter the expats again to sort things out. One comment. If the jobs have been vacant for so long; do you actually need the jobs?	0

Each of the states has their own cultural clubs; sometime they are also formed in religious basis; and also in district / local bodies level.Ha Ha There are no Restra in the type of Motimahal or Saravanabhavan or Delhi Darbar...The most hyped one is GARDEN..but is it a good one ??..... better you try for Indianised fast food like ASIANA; CARAVAN etc.. Hindi films ? ( 90% of hindi films are made ASSES for MASSES ) a quote from Cricketer Gavaskar....But you feel Hindi films are as good as Hollywood Classics;;; still you wil not be disappointed.

As far as the reputation of Al Fardan goes; it has a very good reputation in Qatar.

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL?

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

Yes; it's the same PSP 2000 but it's the newer batch Sony produced with a different motherboard. So basically we have to wait for the hack to be develop; same goes for the PSP-3000.	1

OK I understand about alcohol permits and how there is just one shop (must be very busy with a few hundred thousand expats!). i.e. Or is it just Bud; Heineken etc.	Tsardoz - Talking about flavoursome beers; you can buy Franziskaner wheat beer here. Nowehere as good as Schoffer Hoffer but a good compromise considering you're in an almost dry nation. So if you're a SH fan like me; drink your fill before you come over. I remember that terrible desperation when Dan Murphy's stopped stocking this beer in Melbourne. After a brief search I found it at Vintage Liquors (Coles). You can get your share of euro lagers as mentioned by previous posters. As a true blue Aussie; I'm sure you'd understand if I said I can piss better than a Bud and won't touch Fosters with a stick. VB; Guinness and Kilkenny can be found here too. Sadly no XXXX or Carlton Cold. If you're feeling adventurous or want to slum it; try Kingfisher Strong. As an Indian I'd also recommend the regular Kingfisher (American style macro lager). Not similar to the one that can be purchased in Oz. That's made in New Zealand under license.	1

Maybe they just got it in? It's not a beer I'm used to so I didn't really pay much attention to it.	1

If you like to imbibe as I do (and it seems Mr Paul does though why he comes to Qatar rather than BAH is a mystery) then it is much cheaper in Bahrain.

Accommodation is cheaper; but everything else is almost the same. I'd say on average its a bit cheaper. Of course you do have less variety.  When it comes to upper class fun; it's around 50BD per person for full three course meal with a bottle of wine or date juice plus belly dancer. It's around 60BD in Qatar. ___________________________ Click here for Qatar info	1

My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?	I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.	1

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Drive through Saudi is NOT dangerous. The road is absolutely normal; just keep away from trucks. The only problem is total lack of gas stations. However as it has been told here - it is not fun; and the only reason to do so is probably shopping in IKEA.	0

You save on air fare (specially if there are more than one persons travelling) and then on taxis in UAE. Do what u think is best but it is not dangerous inside saudi. It is just a normal highway.	0

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	If you look at older maps; there is a land route connecting qatar with UAE. What happened to it? well; one day the saudis decided they would take it over; and did so; murdering some qatari border guards in the process. http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/qatar-government.htm When I lived in Oman; the same sort of thing happened to a piece of land bordering the UAE...which is why Oman is split in two pieces.	0

I am not sure about Rams comment; When i checked at some typing centers they the info i got was that you should be under same company sponsorship to have signatory in computer card. I know about another situation: If company "A" is a branch of a main company under same sponsor and same partners (where R is one of parter) and Mr.R's visa is under the main company; he can be signatory in company A.	1

There is however always the possibility of some narrrow minded person making an objection.

When on the Qtel website looking at TV packages; it states in small print that that cost of each package includes basic 1mb and landline. Had mine installed the other week. I think many people; including myself have to have the basic 250QR package installed then can update once installed. I expected the internet to be appalling but it actually isnt that bad! When streaming UK sites through my VPN connection; it runs smoothly and does not cut out. I've added the sports channels now but to be fair; even if you paid top dollar for all the tv channels; the vast majority of them are pretty naff.	1

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	1

I am married with no kids and considering a reasonable life style.	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvZPEw-J5bI	In the last 2 days I have seen five accidents on the streets. This is a clip from a Russian campaign against traffic violations. We need something like this in Qatar. Words are definitely not enough.	we need a harsher set of penalties for moving violations. For example; mandatory jail time for repeat offenders; car impoundment and costly storage; suspension of driving privileges with prison term for driving with a suspended licenses; and the like. We also need a strong public education program to remind drivers of the rules and courtesy rules and to let them know the penalties set by law for violations. Of course; all that will not be needed if we had a little more courtesy and respect for others	1

No one seemed to pay any attention. Do you have to be under 60 years old to use that road ?	0

It says that the speed limit is 60. got that? If people follow the sign or not; this is not the sign's mistake. It's the crazy drivers' I wish the safety for everyone	0

The most annoying is when they come from behind at full speed with lights flashing; then drive so close to almost touch yor bumper/fender that they put you in danger ( never mind themselves; but who cares) I simply refuse to move over and slow down; althoug I usually get a mouthful in arabic or gesture of some kind at the next lights/roundabout (which is met with silence and a smile) but the message is delivered.

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....	1

But they confirmed this to the newspaper. Any schools should set guidelines .. Even if a child gets a good sleep; it is normal for her to fall asleep in bus. Buses come as early as 6 a.m.	0

There was a similar case in Abudhabi last year I think......looks like this type of incident are not uncommon in this temperature. Schools need to be extra cautious with strict laws.	1

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....	1

How to Calculate The Distance between us to The Thunder Light ?	At October - November in Doha; there will be transition from summer to winter. There will be a lot of Thunder / Lightning / Flash.	<img src="http://www.islandnet.com/~see/weather/graphics/photos/lighthun.gif" width=350 height=180 /> <b>Explanation:</b> Calculate how many seconds when you saw the flash of lightning; until you hear thunder then divide the value by 3 to know the distance in Kilometers or divide by 5 to know the distances in Miles <b>Example: </b> You see flashes of lightning; 12 seconds later; his voice booming. So the distance of lightning by yourself is 12 / 3 = 4 km (approximately ) When the flash light; at that time we also see it immediately; because the speed of light is very high; 299;792;458 meters per second. There's almost no delay to reach our eyes. But; the speed of sound "only" 331 meters per second. As a result; some time after the lightning lit; the new voice boomed. Therefore; the distance of lightning with thunder listeners about a mile every three seconds. Thunder is rarely heard at a distance of more than 25 kilometers. <img src="http://u.kaskus.us/3/mfibgiyr.gif" width=250 height=150 /> Good Article... by Aikon	1

My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?	I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.	1

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Drive through Saudi is NOT dangerous. The road is absolutely normal; just keep away from trucks. The only problem is total lack of gas stations. However as it has been told here - it is not fun; and the only reason to do so is probably shopping in IKEA.	0

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Driving to UAE is a lot cheaper than flying. You save on air fare (specially if there are more than one persons travelling) and then on taxis in UAE. Do what u think is best but it is not dangerous inside saudi. It is just a normal highway.	0

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Highway is normal. I think now its a 2 lane track. THere are a few petrol stations when you cross the saudi border from doha. After that the next station is around 150 kms away.	0

But for saudi transit visa just go to the agent and you will get it stamped in 5days.	1

What happened to it? well; one day the saudis decided they would take it over; and did so; murdering some qatari border guards in the process. http://www.arab.de/arabinfo/qatar-government.htm When I lived in Oman; the same sort of thing happened to a piece of land bordering the UAE...which is why Oman is split in two pieces.	0
How long will he be able to stay in Qatar? Is there a way to extend his tourist visa?	Help!!! My friend came to Qatar last 29 August using a tourist visa. He is on his way to change his tourist visa to rp but he is quite concerned that his rp may not come out before the Eid holidays. They were telling that theres no work for immigration for 10 days due to Eid holidays that might start next Friday or Saturday.	YES; you need to go to the Immigration Building # 4; Madinah Khalifa. First of all; ask the typist (outside Building # 4) to type ur tourist visa extention application; then go to building # 4 with that application and original passport. They will charge u QR 100/- for one month visa extention.	1

He is quite afraid that he will go exit if his RP does not come out before the Eid holidays. He was only issued a 30 day tourist visit.	0

Because; 6 months back I have arranged Tourist Visa for one of my relatives to come to Qatar through Cleopatra Travels. At the time of applying Visa itself; PRO of Travel Agent had warned that it was strictly unextendable. The simple logic is if there is any chance for renewal; the process must start from sponsor i.e. Travel Agent and defnitely not by us. Anyway; you may enquire at Immigration at Garaffa. So my advice is better not to take any risk or chances of overstay since the penalties are hefty. Good luck.	1

So I am also worried about the same. Any clue?	0

Dear Vinith; The travel agency that we took the tourist visit visa told us that tourist visas cannot be extended beyond 30 days of stay. They offered us to make an exit to Bahrain and go back to Doha for a new 30-day tourist visa. However; we opted that to transfer his tourist visa to business visa to the company that hired him and without going out of the country. It will be easy for him to transfer from business visa to RP because his sponsor is his company.	1

Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled.	6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However; the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4; any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However; this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior; or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor; according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

Don't say that only Indians are doing this. The software you mentioned to download audio/video stuff and books from the internet; certainly would not be from India and the stuff that is copied on Torrents (as I mentioned in an earlier thread) is also not copied by Indians only. Most of the tools to get pirated stuff online are invented in those developed countries where giant software companies are battling against piracy in underdeveloped countries. So; don't blame a particular country. Just fight against Piracy as it is illegal and not good; no matter where is it.

There are some nationalities which are "frowned upon" by the Qatari government (due to political reasons). Jordanians; Iraqis; Palestinians (from abroad) and indians too as they always try to regulate the ratios of nationalities in the country.	1

I'm talking about visit visa being stopped completely for everyone; not any specific nationality. Both persons that told me this went to the airport branch.

Does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency?	Gold price is steadily increasing.	Its because the dollar is tumbling and festival and marriage season in India	1
Does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency?	Gold price is steadily increasing.	it is the international trend; recently India bought a significant quantity of gold and it seems to go on buying; from FMI; so the price grows up. Check the international market trend; now is around 1100 US$/ounce; after the FMI sold cca 1/2 from it's reserve of cca 400 tons gold. Will increase in my opinion; too; because in crisis everybody invests in gold.	1
Does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency?	Gold price is steadily increasing.	Low dollar price pushes up the gold price as a hedge against possible future inflation.	1
Does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency?	Gold price is steadily increasing.	Due to high demand of gold in India & other country because of festival and safe money to invest.	1
Does it show the poor foundation of the fiat currency?	Gold price is steadily increasing.	Because IMF just sell a record quantity of gold to the Central bank of India and look like China will follow suit. Also because people are nervous about holding on to the US dollar due to the US inflation rate and the perceived slowness of recovery compared to the other economy. Bad news for those receiving their income in US dollar or other currencies fixed-pegged to the greenback (such as Qatari Riyals)	1

Really cuts into the 'break' and means Friday evening out is a 'no no'. I think they use Saturday morning to hold meetings to catch up on events; but I often forget it's a half day and get a surprise (pleasant) when hub suddenly appears home around 1.00 p.m. or earlier.

Do you think it is right? if YES/NO then why?	Iam here in qatar for about 6 &1/2 years. Many people have said to me that they are happy about the Qatari youngsters attitiude towards the women because these guys are not starring at our wives & daughters in a bad sense like we experience in our countries.	Yes it is right. Qataris are interested in Arabic ladies or any lady exposing her body openly. . I have seen them following only ARABIC LADIES. They just stare at western Ladies.	1

Depends what you consider "a bad sense". While a lot of religion's claim that lust is some sort of a sin; without it the human race would be in dire trouble as no one would procreate. People lust after people they perceive as fertile and viable for successful procreation; it's actually a biological form of flattery.	0

During my short visit I got the impression that Muslim or not; it's each individual's decision (or sometimes her family's or community's decision) and if no veil is chosen (whether for the hair alone/hijab or hair and face/burka/niqab) that modest dress is ok.	1

Samsung Omnia...is very good since it comes with a touch screen as all navigation hardware should be.....It also has 5MP camera!!! The best thing about Mobile Phone GPS is you can install Other GPS software other than the company provided GPS Free GPS softwares are Google Maps & Nav4All But Garmin has the best "looking" software although all the info provided are the same!!! The free software do not provide Voice Assistance & do the Route Plan. Free GPS software: 1. Shows where you are in real time. 2. Shows your destination. So the only thing missing is the Voice Assistance. Route planning is hardly required......unless you plan to travel into the desert alone. Buying Garmin GPS software cost $200 .... almost a third the price of an entry level GPS Phone. Doesnt make sense to buy it when there are free software!	1

Nuvi 300 Series - 350; 360...... Nuvi 500 Series Nuvi 600 Series - this has a flip antenna unlike other nuvis Nuvi 700 Series expensive of other series with lane direction and 3D building maps (useful in Europe and US). so the Middle East Map version 5 2008 costs 550 riyals with the garmin dealer. Except the Nuvi 205W series all other gaming comes with either Europe or US maps pre loaded as compliment. Nuvi 205W series costs 950 riyals comes with ARABIC middle east maps as preloaded map. I can be contacted if you want English Middle East Maps. again if you choose to buy Nuvi 205W; you dont need to buy the Middle east map additional. All the best.	1

You can unlock it to install iGO; Garmin; TomTom and many others and it works great with all of them. If you unlock it; your life will be easy and you will also be able to play DivX movies on it !!!	1

there are so many destinations in the world but where would be the ideal place for anybody? ?	what would be the best place to spend the summer holidays.	From personal experience i found Thailand to be very beatiful and its a cheap getaway if your ever on a budget. The people are great; prices are cheap; water is beautiful; don't go to bangkok; go straight to phucket and just enjoyyyyyyy! I was also working in korea for nearly 4 years; Seoul korea is very similiar to Japan like nouf84 said. that city never sleeps i swear! If your looking for a summer getaway i think japan;thailand and korea will all be a tad to hot in the summer; should probably go to someplace that is less humid and hot. Hmmm.. i need to do some more traveling i think.	1

It's Amazing; especially Ha Loong Bay and Hanoi. For cooler destinations I recommend Scotland and Banff; Alberta up in the Rocky Mountains. Absolutely beautiful and not to hot and loads of hiking; kyaking and other stuff to do.	1

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....	1

It could help the ports issue; but as I said earlier I have no issue with UTorrent on the normal DSL so have not moved to fibre yet. It definitely helps with the "waving finger" on blocked websites.

My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?	I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.	1

However as it has been told here - it is not fun; and the only reason to do so is probably shopping in IKEA.	0

I was/am on Atkins quite frequently and lost weight also. But I found some problems like getting hyper on staff/customers; not been able to talk much etc etc. So I dont observe atkins regularly. May be two weeks on atkins and then break for some days/week and then again on atkins. Yes atkins certainly helped me in loosing weight . Foods you can include (apart from chicken) is eggs ( all type); zero cola; bottle gourd; egg plant; okra;cheese; fish; tuna; salads. One thing more is>>> lime juice once in day (especially in morning before food). This is not recommended in Atkins coz of bit high in carb but it help in making your food balance to more alkaline compared to acidic food.	1

Well;i never tried getting so fat and too skinny in my entire life.maybe it's an advantage that I don't like to eat something sweet. I eat chocolates once for two months or nothing at all. I just don't like it. I do walk sometimes whenever I get the chance. I eat not too small not too plenty..but my weight is the same. I guess my physique is really like this..But sometimes; i'd still want to lose a few pounds but my friends are telling me no need to lose anything..they tell me i'm getting paranoid sometimes..:(	0

I don't know if you guys have read the article in the local english newspaper about some scientific findings that exercising is actually not the key to being skinny....I think that's bull; though. And anyway; scientists always scares me. Them and their "findings". I do try to get exercise when I can; which is not a lot of times since i'm soooo busy lately. If I can't do that; I go do Atkins. I loooove eating; and i get so guilty that I have to diet after. It's like a yo-yo diet. Not good; I know; but what do I do when I don't have time for exercise?	0

I have found that Atkins in Qatar is really difficult... I lost over 50kgs on it and kept it off for 3 years (including 2.5years in Qatar) - then about 2 years ago; I just couldn't contain myself with all the good food - hummous; arabic bread; naan; butter chicken... etc... Techincally; I shouldn't have had a much of a problem - you can eat kebab with Rocket leaves and onions - or in salad - chicken doesn't have to be your only option. Brunch at a Hotel on Sundays is brilliant - Berries; eggs and turkey/beef bacon; sausages; meat - thats all allowed. What about making a smoothie of cream; berries and ice? Omelettes with mushrooms; greem peppers; diced chicken and cheeze.... There are lots of choices.... Have you seen this.... http://www.atkins.com/Program/low-carb-online-tools.aspx There is a tab that will take you to meal plans and recipes.... try it:-) You have just inspired me to start again....	1

I don't think I inspire you...I think it is the other way around! Thanks for sharing. :) From what I know; I'm not allowed to eat fruits. Berries are fruits; right? I'm still in induction phase; sorta. I'm at it for almost 2 weeks now; and believe you me; I lost almost 3 kilos already! It works; it works; it works people! Ok; after the induction phase then I can start introducing carbs in my diet...by now i've no appetite for carbs; really. I've lost it couple of days ago. I'm just bored with the same old food that's all. I guess my problem is i'm too tired to prepare something new and something on my own. Lazy; lazy; lazy. Eating out is a pain; since if you eat steaks (which I loooove) you get carbs as side dish. I don't want to be tempted! Quickest way is the good ol' chicken. I shouldn't complain I know. I'm switching to kebab. Thanks for the tips; i'm going to try out your suggestions!	1

I used to work out for an hour and a half 5 days a week and was skinny as a rail. Used to eat & drink whatever I wanted and wouldn't gain a pound. Met my husband and changed jobs; suddenly the workout time disappears and 2 years later here I am 20kg heavier and struggling to lose it; despite trying every diet in the book.

I was there playing volleyball; and I know the difference between sharks and dolphins. if you saw the dorsal fin and looked at it; you would have seen it was dolphins... and if you saw them come up for breaths; then you would know that sharks don't come up for breaths. so... let's not create an unnessecary hype that might scare people from the beach. all you really need to worry about at sealine right now; are the jellyfish and the crazy drivers!	1

Yes it is right. Qataris are interested in Arabic ladies or any lady exposing her body openly. . I have seen them following only ARABIC LADIES. They just stare at western Ladies.	1

Depends what you consider "a bad sense". While a lot of religion's claim that lust is some sort of a sin; without it the human race would be in dire trouble as no one would procreate. People lust after people they perceive as fertile and viable for successful procreation; it's actually a biological form of flattery.	0

Hi all; here to discuss the cars prices in Qatar and the best auto deal. All advices for cars in DOHA!	Qatar does not have websites for most commerce. Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars. Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.	0

I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible.. THEY DONT SERVICE THE CAR AT ALL..JUST DO OIL AND FILTER CHANGE ALL THE TIME... ASK THEM FOR SERVICE AND THEY WILL TALK OF A SCHEDULE OF LEAVING THE CAR THERE FOR FEW DAYS (USUALLY 3 DAYS)... IF YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF A DENT ON YOUR CAR..IT WILL TAKE A WEEK FOR THEM TO REPAIR IT... WHY SELL CARS IF YOU CANT SERVICE THEM??

Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	This new branch is open now; classes have started last week. I've heard there are 97% Arab children; almost no American or European kids... http://www.qatarliving.com/node/14180	1
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	Dear Olivka; What you have heard is not true regarding the nationality of children at the school which is in Al-Waab near Sports City that has opened only this week. A friend of mine has her children registered there and she tells me that there are hardly any Arab children there. The majority of kids are those of RasGas;Qatar Gas and Qatar Airways employees who are not Qataris or Arabs. I am also told that all the teachers are British and the building is great. From what she told me; if I had kids I would have taken them there.	1
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	It seems to me that there is some confusion. Yes; there are many Qatari children at the D Ring Road branch of Newton International School and there are plenty of them at the West Bay school; as well as quite a few Arab-speaking children who are not from Qatar. However; I am reliably informed that the new Newton British School in Al-Waab does not admit Qataris; although there may be one or two Arab-speaking children who are not Qataris. Like some other schools in Doha; the Newton International School at West Bay and the school at D Ring are supposed to follow the English National Curriculum. However; Islamic Studies and Arabic are definitely not part of the English National Curriculum; but nevertheless these subjects take up a significant slice of the available teaching time. This means that there is less time available for other subjects; such as Maths; Science and English. Another important point to remember is that the school day for many schools in Doha is significantly shorter than.....	1
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	My two sons were in the Newton school last year. Kids are from multi-nationalities I didn't like the school for several reasons. One of them that they don't teach enough Arabic or Islamic studies. Some of the other reasons are as following: Kids were seen unsupevised most of the times some Teachers and people in admition office are not polite. Thy yeal to parents and kids all the time. one of the teacher don't explain any thing in the class he only set on his seat with a labtop to watch football. my son didn't have a math teacher for half a year. they don't have swimming pool as they said when we enroll my sons. ....and many other things. My children now in a different school.	0
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	I've been there and I saw with my own eyes - kids there are almost 97% from Arabic countries. Yes; they have British system but kids on break time speak Arabic... For Muslim parents this school is the best choice - their kids will learn Arabic from their schoolmates very fast and English from the teachers... For the other parents who are not interested in their kids to be fluent in Arabic maybe it's better to find another alternative...For example; schools where kids are from European countries and can learn French; Dutch; or Spanish as second language. The only problem it's hard to get in those schools... The best way to know is not to rely on forum advises but go and see it yourself; isn't it?	0
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	I was at Newton British School with my friend whose kids are studying there yesterday. I am sorry Olivka but you don't know what you are talking about. There are almost zero Arabs in the school and the kids talk in English during their break time because they don't know Arabic; I heard them myself! I am speaking about Newton British School in Al-Waab near Sport City. Sorry Olivka but you are completely wrong and as I have found from the regisrar the children are from the USA; Australia; the UK; Canada; Germany; Japan;New Zealand etc. The school has just opened but have a serious enterance examination. Sorry but 97% of students from Arabic countries does not apply to any school in Qatar that uses English as a medium of education let alone NBS.	1

Wow; that's amazing. Two diametrically opposed eyewitness accounts of a both a school's ethnic make up and the language the children are speaking. Certainly makes me wonder about the validity of observations here on QL. But perhaps what we have here is a "failure to communicate" and there's been a misunderstanding about which branch each of you are speaking of. Mandi	0
Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	Let's start again. There are now THREE different branches of Newton. Two are called "Newton International School" and one is called "Newton British School". The two branches of N.I.S. are in West Bay and the other is next to the D Ring Road (aka Al Mamoura). Newton British School is in Al Waab; just round the corner from Villagio. Now the two branches of N.I.S. have a significant number of Qatari children; together with other Arab-speaking children; as well as expat children. The Newton British School does not have any Qatari children (to the best of my knowledge) and only a few Arab-speaking children. The two branches of N.I.S. have Arabic and Islamic Studies on the curriculum; whereas the Newton British School does not. I hope that this clears up any misunderstandings. If you really do not believe me; then perhaps the sensible thing would be for you to go to each one of these schools and see for yourself.

Anyone aware of this? Still under construction; but wondering? ?	I see on the Sportscity road (close to Villaggio) a construction site with a banner Newton British school; that recently appeared.	I can agree that the Newton British School has a good mixture of nationalities without any one nationality dominating. They are following the National Curriculum of England and Wales and they have a high pass rate expectation for their entrance tests. People will be very short sighted to write off this school - lovely small classes with friendly staff and good academic levels ... and thats exactly what I want for my children!	0

If she is flying in to visit you (I presume you're both western and non-Muslim); then the hotel people will never know if she's your wife or your girlfriend. Tell them she's your wife; book one room; and enjoy yourselves. Most westerners don't have their marital status or spouses names listed on their passports (as is common here). You also wouldn't necessarily carry your marriage certificate around with you (again; not common for us); so kind of a "that's my story and I'm sticking to it" strategy. Good luck!	1

Is that good for his experience and sufficient for the two of us? Can anyone help please?	Dear all; I am planning to settle in Doha with my husband as he has got a job there. He is a software professional with an MBA having around 18 years of experience. He has been offered a salary of 18;000. Also would like to know the general cost of living in Doha; good apartments to live in (not sure of the area yet).	Welcome to Doha.... rent for a two bed room apartment varies from QR. 4000-5000; the cost of living is going up; & its enough for a reasonable living. the most beautiful about doha life is "its calm & tranquil-ably happy"	1

Also would like to know the general cost of living in Doha; good apartments to live in (not sure of the area yet).	Depends; If you are Western educated than the salary for 18 years experience with MBA is way too low. It should be in the range QAR 40000-45000 (including accomodation). A new villa in a compound will cost you QAR 12;500 upwards. Make sure that you move in a brand new place since quality of accomodation is pretty lousy. Note that Doha is a pretty dull place and does not offer the expat life available in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.	1

The rent for a two bed room fully furnished apartment varies from QR. 6000-7000; the cost of living is going up; approximately 4000 QR for two family members; plus bills.

With an MBA and 18 years of experience; you can get better than 18.000. I personally think you should not accept less than 25-30 thousand riyals a month. Bear in mind that; to keep the same standard of life; accommodation will be more than the 6000 mentioned in some comments here.	1

Thanks everyone for the quick response :) We are not completely aware of all the job details as yet; but I guess medical insurance may be covered. Since we felt it was low; we are still negotiating with them.... Just wanted to check how much would it be for the insurance and transportation (car rental options)?	0

I don't recommend. to enjoy your stay at Qatar; you should get an apartment in a compound. You will never find any for less than 10;000 QAR. Cost living for two expats persons is minimum 4000 QAR. to Rent a good; not luxury; car you need at least 2000 QAR. The Insurance should be provided by the company. As I see at Qatar; British with 18 years of experience is getting around 50;000 QAR as a basic salary.	1

Most of the people from UK who are working here are renting villas for 12;000 - 20;000 QAR which means that it's their housing allowance. I guess the offer is small for you but it depends on your needs. Ask triple of the offer..	1

Advice them to go to nearest DHL office in your area 4. they will pay 2500 Pesos for DHL charges 5. Wait for 7 working days they sent you SMS for collecting the passport from DHL office. 6. after you receive the original passport from DHL verify the Visa Stamp in the passport. if ok then go through Travel Agency and book them according to your wish. They have 3 months validity to enter Qatar. 7. In immigration they will ask so many question but if you tell them that your husband or wife is an Engineer they will not think twice they will stamp quickly and say ok. Welcome to Qatar	1

Anyone have other suggestions?	Just curious to see if anyone has any good suggestions for places to run in Doha. The only posts I have found say the Corniche. That is kind of obvious :).

The new park behind Hyatt Plaza is lovely and has a path all the way round with that slightly bouncy rubber surface (which they seem to be repairing already . . .).	1

I understand is thousands units were available in different areas; for affordable prices.. but since qatar cannot provide a normal level of affordable houses; no point to demand to follow certain rules.. do you know how hard to find a house for let's say single western female? Next to impossible! All are either "for males"; or for "indians"; or for "filipinos".. so what this western lady should do? if she for example cannot afford or simly doesn't want to pay a fortune for little miserable independent cage?? when at the same time she can find nice room in sharing with males villa for half price? eh? ********************* "What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us."

Any advice out there?	Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	1

I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	1

Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	1

Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating.

Why donÂ´t you date our friend here; Gineeshlee; he wants more than sex...or so it seems. Anyways; on a serious note. IÂ´ve seen too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately...and you know what; Qataries are much better behaved than that. At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut. If you behave like a lady; chances are that you might find someone that treats you like a lady.	1

Rajnikanth taught Chuck Norris how to deliver roundhouse kicks. 2. Rajnikanth once roundhouse kicked a Tata truck in Chennai. It became the Tata Nano and fell on Mamata Banerjees head in Kolkata. 3. Rajinikanth reverses Court judgements by making the ink run back into the Judges ballpen. 4. Rajinikanth once boarded a Virgin Atlantic flight from Chennai to New York. The stewards served the tea cold. So when the flight finally touched down; it was just Atlantic. 5. Matrix was originally planned in Tamil as with Rajinikanth as Rajinikanth. But the bullets were so shit scared that they pissed in the barrels and refused to come out of the guns in his presence. 6. Rajinikanth once went to Jim Corbett National Park. After eight straight hours of snapping pictures; the tired tigers ran out of camera film. 7. Rajinikanth doesnt need to sleep with a gun under his pillow. He is deadlier with the pillow. 8. The movie 300 was initially planned to be made with Rajinikanth. It was originally named 1. 9. Rajinikanth is so flexible; he can lick his elbow. 10. Hes also so smart; he knows youd try to do it after reading that. 11. Raincoats were developed to prevent raindrops from getting electrocuted on coming within 1oo metres of Rajinikanth. 12. Rajinikanth has successfully reversed global warming. All the glaciers just froze when they heard his name. 13. Rajinikanth once dived into the sea from his Chennai condo. The next thing you know is that a tsunami has hit half the world. 14. The Chennai Delhi Rajdhani Express once missed Rajinikanth. It ran as fast as it could but failed to catch him. 15.

Rajinikanth has already given us 33;945 laws of commotion andthe count is far from completed. 18. No one messes with Rajinikanth. Only Rajinikanth can mess with himself. 19. Sunny Deol once thrashed a battalion of Pakistanis with his bare hands. Rajinikanth can thrash 1000 such Sunny Deols with his bare tongue. 20. Parachutes were invented just to prevent the earth from getting shattered to pieces when hit by a falling Rajinikanth. 21. Only two things on earth are visible from space. Rajinikanth in his mundu and some wall in Africa. Or is that in China? 22. What colour is Rajinikanths blood? Haha! Trick question! Rajinikanth never bleeds!! 23. Rajinikanth is faster than email. He is now officially the second fastest thing in the Universe after MMS. 24. Rajinikanth uses pepper spray as eye drops. 25. Man proposes; Rajinikanth disposes. And disposes fast	1

MM; you have been on a long emergency leave; normally a leave would be for one month; did you officially request your company that they extend your leave to cover this 5 month period that you have been out of the country or has it been absence without permission. do you have email communications etc supporting your request. hope you have a copy of the resignation letter that you had sent to them and the rejection. i am not sure about the rules applicable for a company sponsored individual to come on husband sponsor within the year.	1

Hi all; here to discuss the cars prices in Qatar and the best auto deal. All advices for cars in DOHA!	Qatar does not have websites for most commerce. Best car to drive depends on what you want to do; only town; off road; racing (to AlKhor and back). Prices are comparable to US cost. If you get a used car; be careful. Qataris are hard on cars. Try to find an Expat leaving town. Lease for a month; learn to drive here in somebody elses car; see what you can find and then buy.	0

I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible.. THEY DONT SERVICE THE CAR AT ALL..JUST DO OIL AND FILTER CHANGE ALL THE TIME... ASK THEM FOR SERVICE AND THEY WILL TALK OF A SCHEDULE OF LEAVING THE CAR THERE FOR FEW DAYS (USUALLY 3 DAYS)... IF YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF A DENT ON YOUR CAR..IT WILL TAKE A WEEK FOR THEM TO REPAIR IT... WHY SELL CARS IF YOU CANT SERVICE THEM?? NISSAN CARS ARE REALLY GOOD..but the dealership at QATAR is a living SHAME...	0

Do I get any fine?	I was unaware of red light tonight and i passed about one car length from the traffic light and stopped. But it flashed 2-3 times.	If you STOPPED; the fine will not exceed QR500; if you corrected your position and returned back the fine will not exceed QR300; if you stopped on the yellow lines and remain on that it may reach to QR 1000.

Did you come backwards after stopping the Vehicle the moment you see the RED lights?

Do I get any fine?	I was unaware of red light tonight and i passed about one car length from the traffic light and stopped. But it flashed 2-3 times.	Yes you'll be fine for beating the red light amounting 3000 QRs plus additional 7 black points in your license. before the revision of the penalties it was 6000 QRs... Next time be circumspect upon driving specially when passing to a traffic signal bro! Cheers	1
Do I get any fine?	I was unaware of red light tonight and i passed about one car length from the traffic light and stopped. But it flashed 2-3 times.	if u don't stop the red light the finalty was 6;000. always remember if u see signal light reduce ur speed limit to avoid violation.	1

Just wanted to ask existing users; is it a good thing to buy? BUT is it worth buying? and Is the improvement recognisable?	Well iv heard lots of things about the kn filter and thought i might get one installed in my 2009 VXR for about 500QR. I mean i know that it improves the hp; accelleration..blah blah..	First-It will not boost your horspower or acceleration anything considerable-if you where racing and a 1/100th of a second counted then ok. Also; more importantly; as AbuAmerican said-it could void your warranty- check with Toyota first.	1

Agree with all the above - it's a bus for #$%& sake. The difference is negligable.

Bro; I agree with cdpascual initial performance gainer would be Intake/Header/Exhaust modifications. If you modifed the Intake plate filter (K&N) then you have to modify your header (use S/S Mandrel bend headers) and an aftermarket exhaust chambered/free-flow muffler ( ex.Tanabe G-Medallion) plus a layer of thermal wrap to ever notice performance. If you can afford a Cold Air Intake that would be better; with all this modifications this would surely void your warranty. Cheers;	1

Next to impossible! All are either "for males"; or for "indians"; or for "filipinos".. so what this western lady should do? if she for example cannot afford or simly doesn't want to pay a fortune for little miserable independent cage?? when at the same time she can find nice room in sharing with males villa for half price? eh? ********************* "What lies behind us and what lies before us are small compared to what lies within us."

Does it make any sense?	Hello everybody; I would like to know why they don't allow for people over 63 y.o. to visit Qatar.	them roof ; them rules ! you compmain about it ; get deported !	0
Does it make any sense?	Hello everybody; I would like to know why they don't allow for people over 63 y.o. to visit Qatar.	Because some nationalities are more likely to bring over elderly relatives to take advantage of the healthcare that is provided here. And those same nationalities are less likely to come and visit here and spend lots of money on accomodation; shopping etc. Unless you are contributing to the economy; either as a wage earner or a high spending tourist; you aren't really welcome here. And if your parents are that age; you should be visiting them; not vice versa.	1
Does it make any sense?	Hello everybody; I would like to know why they don't allow for people over 63 y.o. to visit Qatar.	Seniors Both my parents as well as my inlaws have come here to visit our family. All 4 people were well in their 70's; so don't think that is the rule.	0

Does it make any sense?	Hello everybody; I would like to know why they don't allow for people over 63 y.o. to visit Qatar.	Yes; you need to talk to the Authorised person in the visa office to get a special permission. I did for my mother and without any hassel he signed my documents.	1
Does it make any sense?	Hello everybody; I would like to know why they don't allow for people over 63 y.o. to visit Qatar.	I read a post from deedee that all his parents and the in-laws above 70 years were able to visit Qatar. deedee it depends on your Nationality and I know yours. It will not be the same for someone from Asia. They should approach the concerend Officers to special approvl for it.	1

Does it make any sense?	Hello everybody; I would like to know why they don't allow for people over 63 y.o. to visit Qatar.	Well I don't believe it has anything to do with the health care issue. First of all HMC only treats for free those who have a health card and therefore they must be residents not visitors; if you don't have a health card you'll pay for whatever treatment you get except for emergencies. Second thought let us say it was really all about health care issues and not providing the emergency cases for free to sick elders who are none residents then simply the sponsor could be asked to sign a form where he will be responsible for any unsettled treatment payments for a visiting relative; or perhaps those over a certain age could pay in the airport a health insurance fee; instead of simply not allowing the elderly -who should be treated with more respect honestly- to enter. After all what's the median age of the parents of working residents here? 40? I don't think so. But as some people say it's their roof; their country; let them do with it what ever they want.	1

What is the best time to migrate to Qatar for Job searching in Software Development Area?	As each country / state has some peek time for job searching.	All 365 days are peak period for job seekers in Qatar.

I think so. If you only want to see sea beach then Dukhan is ok. There are no sharks but there are Channa Fish at Dukhan. Beware of Channa Fish! They are very dangerous; especially during the onset of winter. They generally don't attack humans; but if they are hungry they may eat humans! This happens especially when the Channa grows old and lazy and doesn't want to hunt; then they come near the beach to grab easy prey(the human bathers). If you want to be safe from the Channa eat lots of Garlic and apply Garlic spray on your body because; the only thing that can repulse a Channa is Garlic! Have a nice swim at Dukhan! Cya.	1

The 'Today' show gives her a second chance to get it right; and News Blogger Mo Rocca poses a challenge: Take her words and rearrange them to make sense.	It's not this girl who thinks that one-fifth Americans can not locate the USA on the map. Aimee Teegarden from some newspapper asked her this question: what does she thinks; WHY one-fifth Americans can not allocate the USA on the map.? And this poor girl started talking about some South Africans; Asian countries.. . it just shows that she even couldn't get a QUESTION! And also I think; she had some certain answers ready; and she just tried to apply one of them to this question; which was absolutely not applicable. You can hear what she is saying: "I think US should help such places as South Africans; Asian countries with education so that they will be able to build our future for us".. or something like that… Shortly; no sense whatsoever.. but don't forget she is a teenager; and just got lost in front of all this huge audience..	1

Italian Embassy is the worst at handing out Schengen visas. It took me 3 months with lots of hassle to get mine. I hear the French Embassy is way easier; will be going through them next time.	1
is this legal in qatar rent law?	i am renting a room in a shared 4 bedroom flat. the person who signed the contract for the flat does not live with us (only comes at month end to collect rent payments).	Almost all rent contracts include a no-subletting clause.... So he won't be able to do it.	1
is this legal in qatar rent law?	i am renting a room in a shared 4 bedroom flat. the person who signed the contract for the flat does not live with us (only comes at month end to collect rent payments).	Bleu; Most properties are actual sublets by agents; if you read my answer again; you will understand what I am talking about; as long as the sublet is done legally meaning with a contract between the Agent/Landlord and the tennant it is legal. Subletting doesn't only mean renting out a property that was rented from an agent without a contract. these are facts.	1

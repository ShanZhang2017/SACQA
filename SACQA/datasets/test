Once she came; can I convert her visa from business visa to a husband sponsored visa?	Im planning to bring my wife here in Qatar though a business visa which is sponsored by a travel agency.	@ Mayartolba to bring your fiance to Qatar just go to Qatar airways office next to Alama building and apply for a bsuiness visa this is the easiest way.	1

But i'm wishing you luck if you get good treatment as my husband had witnessed how they treat ran away maid. Their reason for acting such is that some of the maids they tried to help would end up going back to their employer. So all the efforts that the embassy had done been put to waste.	0

Can anyone suggest; where should I buy used Land Cruiser?	Hi; I want to buy Pre-owned/used Land Cruiser 2009/2010 model. I have already visited Toyota certified pre-owned cars; Qatar Living; Qatarsales; Oasis; etc. but still confused among them. I have noticed Toyota certified cars are cheaper than any other used car showroom but their cars are under sun; therefore; don't feel comfortable with this fact.	Nothings gona happen if the cars are parked under the sun. They usually don't last that in that lot either. Anyways; my suggestion would be to avoid buying LC from used car showrooms. Most of them are hit somewhere or raped in sealine. Just make sure you take your car for vehicle inspection on Salwa Road even if your buying from Toyota.	0

I have already visited Toyota certified pre-owned cars; Qatar Living; Qatarsales; Oasis; etc. but still confused among them. I have noticed Toyota certified cars are cheaper than any other used car showroom but their cars are under sun; therefore; don't feel comfortable with this fact.	Yup; I am concerned about the owners indeed but hard to find them out if you are buying from Show rooms. Toyota is offering 135 - 145 for 2009 models.	0

is there anything to do?	im a young man 26 year old; married with two kids; falling way over my head with depts; lost everything and the only thing remains for me is my family and am about to lose it and go tp prison. im currently unemployed and even if i work with 20000 QR in a month i wont make it.	sell the kids on ebay? seriously you need a professional financial advisor to try and get your debts steamlined with one bank and then pay off monthly. You should have asked for help before the situaion got this bad - that is the responsibility that goes with being a husband and father. Get professional advice ASAP - not just for u but your family.	1

Does anyone have any ideas?	We are moving at the end of June. We are looking for an apartment that is nice in a good area that is reasonably priced. We would like to live near the water.	There are a lot of places that fit this description; with the exception of reasonable; of course. Rents in Doha are about 4 times what they are in the US and that is mostly because employers pay the bills. Is your husband's company not covering housing? How about school tuition? These are considered standard perks in Doha. I would suggest coming to see first. You REALLY don't want to rent sight unseen here. There are too many nasty surprises.	0

"If the PLUS or Cirrus logo is not visible on your card; then it is advisable to check with your card issuing institution before using it in an overseas cash machine. "LINK is not able to advise about the location of overseas ATMs or about the level of charges which may be applied by the ATM owner." A LINK-enabled card which displays the PLUS (VISA) and/or Cirrus (Mastercard) brand logos can usually be used in an overseas ATM which also displays these logos. However; not all LINK Members take advantage of this international connection facility and so it all depends upon the bank; building society or other card company that issued your card; if the PLUS or Cirrus logo is not visible on your card then it is advisable to check with your card issuing institution before using it in an overseas cash machine.

Hmm.. but neither VISA nor Mastercard; nor my QNB debit cards worked. AFAIK; VISA and Master use different networks. I tried it in all ATMs; even Citibank (which usually works everywhere). And of course QNB denies everything. Only this particular bank in this particular country. Elsewhere; from Brazil to Switzerland no problems with QNB cards at all.

Must be the group or bank; who is or sponsoring the QNB card. Not necesserarily is your bank; is the institution where the alliance for the visa is coming from. It just pop in my mind; Maybe your bank just have the card block; and they need to lift it. That is just another option. One time in Kenya ; my bank block it; because they tought soemone stole it. Neverless to say their security measures are tedious and painfull; but is about customer protection. I did call them and they lift the ban right away. Cardinal OF QATAR LIVING	0

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	1

Take your driving license; two passport size photos and go to a travel agent such as Regency Travels or Mannai Travels; they will charge you 100 to 150 riyals and will give you the International license within few minutes.	1

When the outside temperature reaches 45o temperature; A/C will not work; compressor trips. When I went to Nissan garage they told “ yes it is right; when the temperature goes more than 45 it will not work this is not a fault” anybody else is facing the same problem? Is there any solution for this?	I brought a new Nissan Sunny car. Otherwise it is working fine.	You ask the Nissan dealer to change the compressor. Since your car is new i hope its in warranty period. New cars compressor will work above 45deg temperature. Do it immediately; otherwise they will say warranty period finish or blah blah. Even old cars compressor working above 45 deg temperature.	1

When I check with Nissan dealer @ Sanayya; they told me to put my car 7-10 days over there for checking this problem and to fix it. I request them for a token in Q system so that I can give my car just 2 or 3 days; but they denied. Now a days too horrible to drive in the timing between 12 - 3. Have any other brand this problem???

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	1

I am married with no kids and considering a reasonable life style.	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0

NOC IS No Objection Certificate and releasing an employee that way and applying for another maid visa will be difficult for you as the Labor ministry will question about why have you given a release to an already approved visa; and then applied for the same post.The best procedure for you ; [if you intend to bring another maid that is] is to cancel the visa; sent her home and reapply for a maid visa;you also need to provide evidence about the status of your previous maid visa.	1

You have 2 options only: 1. to find another sponsor for her and to make sure she has transferred her sponsorship properly. 2. to cancel her RP; and then she has to leave within 7 days. Make sure she has left by dropping her to the airport personally. In any other case; if she got caught here without valid RP; you will be in big trouble.	1

Minoush; if you are not satisfied with her; you can give her the option of looking for another job here in Doha; someone who can sponsor her; and then give her the release and let her go; this way she doesn't stay without a job. For this she can place an ad looking for a job with a willing sponsor. She will surely get one. You can also send her back home as well if you are not satisfied with her work.you are not compelled to keep her; just make sure that she is paid all her dues; but to be on the safer side; check what your contract with her states and do the right thing.	1

Hello All; Is Satellite Internet available here? Recommended Providers and Pricing? Does anyone have experience with Satellite Internet here in Qatar?	Apartments where I am at are struggling with abominably slow internet access.	Maybe just call Qtel and find out what the problem is? I pay for a 4MB line and actually connect at 4.8M down / 650k up. Its not blazing fast compared to the western world; but for what it is I can connect to torrents upward of 500k per second. Qtel also offers an 8M line; but there is a restriction on the distance to the local hub. I think they said 800m and mine just happens to be ~1200m away. The tech on the phone did inform me they are working on Fiber Optic; but would not be available for another year (which probably means 2 in Doha time). You can get up to 50MB download speeds in the US with Fiber internet. The biggest problem here is the pricing. Qtel charge a whopping 400QAR for a 4MB line. Anywhere else this speed can be had for a fraction of the cost. Even 5 years ago I was paying the equivalent of ~150QAR for a 4MB line in the US. Prices here are absolutely rediculous!	1

How to convince my boss for providing NOC as she doesn wants me to go? what to do??? please guys give me some ideas how to convince her?	I have completed 6 years n getting better offer now. moreover present company doesn't have the work.	It purely depends upon your relationship. Buy some sweets and try to meet her after office hours if possible. As you both chickas so i guess meeting outside is not so tough. And show her you offer and discuss your future plan with her like you will get married; you have problems in your family; you need to be more financially secured to help them etc. I did the same to leave my previous employer. My Boss was so impressed that he gave me NOC and he gave me his own money too. Of course I dont wanted money from his pocket but my story was so emotional. I guess you got the point.	1

I do belive that once she is convince that you have no other way and will leave her; she will agree for it.

Anyone know how is the management and the facilities are they well maintained ?	We are thinking of moving to Al Bayyan compound.	Al Bayan Compound used to be only for Qatar Petroleum Employees only until recently when they have allowed a certain amount of Villas to be let out to outside people. Generally the Compound is good for the price you are paying for it. Decent size Swimming pool. Rooms are quite big size. It has a shop etc. So on a whole for the price that they are charging it is a good deal. If you want better than you have to pay more.	1

Anyone know how is the management and the facilities are they well maintained ?	We are thinking of moving to Al Bayyan compound.	Based on what I heard from friends who lived there temporarily (newly hired QP employees); or renting there: Pros: - It is decent for the price - location is pretty OK - Villas are good size Cons: - Temporary accommodations for QP newly-hired; high turnover of tenants - Furniture is horrible; old and bulky - Area gets very congested near Saad Stadium when there is a game When it comes to housing; it is relative and greatly depends on your life style and what you are used to. I would say visit a few times and see a few villa's before you make your decision.	1

A VISIT VISA is valid ONLY for 6 months. It is rare to get an extention more than that. And as to a RP your son is over 18 and you will NOT be able to sponsor him.

Small correction here; Eng & Avid;) Your company can issue you an exit permit; but you will still be blocked by the Immigration at the airport during departure; when your name is blacklisted in the system. If you know that you had previous police case( ex. returned cheque); obtaining exit permit doesn't mean that your name is cleared from the system. You must follow up w/ the capital police after 6-months from the date you settled your case to remove the blacklisted of your name in the Immigration airport.	1

My PRO said when they apply for exit permit it will be directed to interior ministry for endorsement. If there is anything against you; your exit permit will be rejected by the system. it is computerised and we are applying for all our immigration requirements through on-line. To clear the black listing you need to go to public procrcutor's office (NIYAMA) and settle your penalties. (near city centre) and the public procecutors office can clear your record within short time if you aooroch them with your lawyer. This is what our lawyer said.	1

I was giving you an example of a police case(ex. returned cheques). Coz this is the common case that can happen to anyone. If your case was filed at Capital Police; you need to clear your name from there. If it was a Court case then you should go to Niyaba. Mostly; the case are to be filed from the Police dept. then forwarded to the court for settlement depends on both the plaintiff & the suspects agreement. Another example is if your bank filed a complaints against you to the capital police for not paying your debts(Car loan; Credit cards; Personal loans); then your name will be blacklist in the system till you settled your accounts. Accordingly; only after 6-months from the date of your settlement before your name is remove from the blacklist. What i'm trying to imply here is; if you know that you had previous but settled criminal or civil cases; nothing wrong to clear your name & follow up at the place where the charges agains.....	1
Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?	While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap.

Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles.	there is a law. No children under 10 in the front seats. Unfortunately this law is not enforced.

Is there not a law regarding child safety in vehicles here in Qatar?	While driving in Doha last night I witness a sad incident. A man was driving with his child on his lap. He had to make an emergency stop and his childs head impacted the steering wheel. The poor child was bleeding and crying. Many times I have seen children not properly secured in vehicles.	in this region subscribe to. But in the end; it's just a stupid rationalization for not doing what would keep your children safe. Especially in light of recent stats on road injuries per capita in Qatar ("Qatar suffered four times more injuries in road accidents per 100;000 people than the second-placed country; Kuwait; and tied with South Africa for the most road deaths; the report shows."); you'd think they might want to start enforcing the laws on the books. I feel sorry for the kids who have these people as parents. But I guess it's just Social Darwinism in action.

What is acceptable?"	My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told "long sleeves and long skirts". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro.....	1

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..	0

Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear "normal" clothes; this is totally acceptable for "western ladies". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela	1

Like western men can wear full dress even in summer so why not women; its islamic country and as per norm i would like to recommend you to come out fully covered.Thanks! Welcome to Qatar	1

Salam Aisha-Taweela; just to correct you habibti...all the Muslim women are not 'totally covered up' as you said. Did you mean shayla and niqab?

Is it cheaper to buy these sorta things in Qatar than in UK?	I'm moving to Doha in next month or so with work. I wanna buy a few things for while I'm there; like new laptop; Blackberry phone; digital camera and some good clothes.	Dixons duty free and save the VAT. I saved 150 pound on my Mac at Heathrow. Pretty much all electronics are MORE expensive here than any where in the World. Pocket digital cameras average about 60-100 pound more. I saw a laptop I brought my Dad in the UK going for almost DOUBLE here in Carrefour. I find it cheaper to shop at amazon and pay aramex to ship it here and it's STILL CHEAPER !! Obviously this won't work with a huge TV but everything else get back home. Also anyone with a residents permit for Qatar can buy stuff in the UK and get the VAT back at the airport. Always remember to do this when you buy expensive things on your holidays.	1

I DONT REALLY KNOW WHICH WATER COMPANYIS MOST CLEAN IN QATAR??? RAYAN; NESTLE OR MANHAL??? ?	HEY; I WANT TO MAKE WATER DELIVERY SUBSCRIBTION TO MY HOUSE ....	I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.	1

Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled.	6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However; the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4; any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However; this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior; or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor; according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

Both KLM and Lufthanza allow you to bring pets from the UK (via Netherlands or Germany) in the cabin. The pet plus the carrier has to weigh under around 8kg (which should be fine for a small breed). Price is surprisingly minimal - it is a fixed excess baggage charge of around £70 (check with airlines). The pet has to be transported in a carrier which fits under the seat (really only during take off and touch down). There are special soft carriers which have a tent-like squashable roof which will fit under the seat and spring back up. The brand that springs to mind is Sturdibag. Good luck! Btw I was told about the airlines by Doha Vets (who were amazingly helpful) and then checked directly with the airlines in the UK; who agreed with this...	1

Have you had experience of animals travelling this way yourself? I had checked with KLM who said exactly as you have; however when 2 companies in the U.K told me this was not allowed it left me feeling very deflated and wondering if it was maybe Doha Airport that dont accept dogs travelling this way. She is our daughters dog but is a very special part of the family and keeping our teenager onside for this move is very important. I really appreciate your replying as I have tried to obtaining this through other blogs; websites to no evail; all say cargo; excess baggage in hold. I will also contact Doha Vets who may be able to help with import certificate and help upon our arrival.	0

It was my impression that only Lufthansa and maybe KLM did this. Mandi	0

Get in touch with Dr Khaled El Hossan (khaled@dohavets.com); he can sort all the paperwork out this end. The import licence is valid for 1 month; but it may be worth finding out how long it takes to get one in the first place... All you will need to do is sort out the export papers from DEFRA at UK end - this is the link to the relevant contacts: http://animalhealth.defra.gov.uk/about/contact-us/tradeexports.html Oh; here is an example of the type of carrier: http://www.zooplus.co.uk/ask?q=sturdi+bag&num=20&form=search&gclid=CMbG7c2d468CFQt66wodhz7NwA This is all theory - I had been planning to bring out my elderly cat (who would have been too stressed in the hold); but as we are not staying in Qatar; will now not need to do this. Hope it all goes well for you and your daughter's dog. Have to say though; August is an awfully brutal month to be bringing the poor thing out there; hope it doesn't have a full coat!	0

Time to put your YT on a diet????? The airline website will give you the maximum dimensions of the carrier (but do not be put off by the height restriction; as these special carriers squash down to the maximum allowed height ~20 cm I think)	1

I don't think that YT will qualify under this scheme; remember the weight of the Pet+carrier has to be 7kg or below 7kg!	0

Yorkies average in at 2-3 kg; my cat is 4 kg and these carriers are designed to be super light; for this exact purpose! Bar chiuauas; I cannot think of a lighter dog. It's worth pursing anyway and DohaVets and the airlines are experts on this; so don't be disheartened. You don't get anywhere without trying....	1

I'm on a roll now - if you check the link I posted; the type of carrier you will need weighs in at 900g...to go over the recommended weight allowance; that would have to be one hell of an obese Yorkie !!! ;-)	0
Any suggestions?	We used to rent at this company and it seems they dont want to return our deposit; they keep on making excuses everytime we call or visit their office.	2 days back i had same issue. i rent a car from one place in al-sadd and he had 350QR to return to me when i returned the car. but he ddint want to return the money that i understood from he talks. the end he found a excuse not to pay that "there is a small scratch on the car" and i have to pay 500QR for that ..but for you i will do it for 350QR" lol... Dont ever rent a car in qatar. and if you want to rent go for some reputed rental companies. these street rentacar companies are rip off.	0

Truth real estate should be called Lies real estate. I've started dealing with them and they seem quite bad. Before I moved in; they promised the rent included cleaning; but I've found it doesn't. I've given them cheques but it's taking a long time to get a lease. You definitely can't trust these people. I suggest you don't pay the agents commission until you get the lease in your hands and I would suggest you don't move out until you get your deposit back.	1

'Easier catch'; 'expensive to keep'; whew! I wish you could have been more subtle here... Nobody is a 'good catch'; buddy. If you find someone who reciprocates your feelings; the question of being expensive doesnt arise. Chances are; one wouldnt let the other bear everything on their own.

How many Asian guys do you see over here; sheer weight of numbers; I would think. Ok but my fiancee thinks its because the asian girls here are more westernised and therefore would have more in common with them. Also there are alot of Asian Girls dating Asian Guys here; perhaps you just don't see them; trust me she is Korean and would know the numbers. Perhaps you don't notice an Asian/Asian couple but notice an Asian white match more because it sticks in your brain. I have seen loads of Fillipino Couples out together; and I am told that Fillipino girls would much rather go out with Fillipino boys here as they have more in common and are not just trated as sex objects which we know many Arab guys do.	1

Just to clarify what I want to find out: Can I and my unmarried girlfriend (who does not have the same family name as me) check in to a hotel and share the same room? And I don't want to go to Spain or Italy. The reason I am looking at Qatar is also that it's approx 6 hours non-stop flying time from BKK and from where I am right now. If she were to visit me or I go to BKK it would take most of a day each way and we only have 4-5 days to spend.	0
Are we allowed to share a hotel room?	In order to use up some mileage I am considering a trip to see more of Doha and Qatar than just the airport.

If you were both white European/Westerners; you probably wouldn't be asked. However; your GF is from Asia and she will attract attention simply because a large number of prostitutes in Qatar are of that ethnicity. There is no guarantee you'd be prevented from staying but there's no guarantee you won't Hotels do keep track of who is checking in with who and may even question ladies who are going up to rooms. I have experienced this myself in a 5* hotel where the hotel had a staff member stationed at the elevators. Might you get away with it? Possibly.	1

Any suggestion? and estimated cost of it?	Friends; I need to buy vacuum cleaner which can use for normal cleaning as well as which can remove cat hairs from Velvet sofas.	I suggest you brush your pets more often. Wet the brush first then the hairs will stick to the brush.	0
Any suggestion? and estimated cost of it?	Friends; I need to buy vacuum cleaner which can use for normal cleaning as well as which can remove cat hairs from Velvet sofas.	there are really not special vacuum cleaner available in the market . It is really not advisable to vacuum clean your cat .you have to be very cautious while doing so as you may scare the cat by the noise and sometime by the accidently stuck your cleaner to the cat skin ( it really scary for the pet). Instead you brush you pet everyday this will help to clean as well as MASSAGE THE SKIN by increasing the circulation of blood. Brush also help to find out the skin affection if any still you want one --buy any small low power/speed hand held portable vacuum cleaner .look for the smallest portable one . hope this will help	1

Or is it being implied that we bury our head in the sand and pretend it does not exist here? Can we continue here ...................?	I did not see anything deserving of sensoring/editing unless we look at the original post; and I am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread 'alive'.	It's not that China; it was deleted because the thread was trolling and promoting prostitution; such threads that promote something whether it was prostitution or otherwise gets deleted. But it wasn't cause of the topic itself so we can continue here :-)	1

I did not see anything deserving of sensoring/editing unless we look at the original post; and I am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread 'alive'.	So let's talk about it here! :-) I'm surprised that prostitution is that open in what is considered a conservative country; I mean if it's so obvious that these women are prostituting them; then I'm sure authorities know about it...the question is...why aren't they doing anything about it ?	1

OK; thats understandable; thank you. It also underlines mir83 and my point that we believed prostitution is less tolerable here in Qatar. However; the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives; until something is said by somebody; and then the routine mass deportations take place. It goes quiet for a while; and then the 'night girls' start building up in numbers again to the level they are now. My last sentence; before the previous thread was deleted was something like this; 'mark my words; the ladies will vanish any day now. Over the few weeks after that; their numbers will slowly increase again; and the cycle repeats it's self'. Obviously somebody is behind this (a pimp); as a sponsor for these girls.	1

If someone is actually behind this (which I believe so); it has to be someone in a high position; someone who has control over authorities...what other explanation is there for the lack of action by the authorities ?	1

Cornellian; somebody answered this on the previous thread just before it was deleted. I cannot recall the poster; but it was suggested that some body in authority; possible with some 'wasta' to throw around; was probably behind it. My apologies if I have not recalled what was said precisely; but I would go along with that theory anyway. There are just far too many girls; far too often; in so many places for it to be anything else. Unless somebody knows differently ofcourse ................?	0

I would guess that the authorities are 'bending' to a certain extent under the threat of this 'person's' wasta. The final breaking point is probably reached when the religious fraternity start to object/speak out.	1

But if that "pimp" is powerful enough to keep the authorities quiet; then he must be powerful enough to keep the religious fraternity too. I think no matter what anyone says or does; prostitution will always exist everywhere; because there will always be women who need the money and men who are ready to pay.	1

I just want to ask if there will be no problem for my future employer in applying visa for me? How will I check or how will I know if my ban is already finished?	Hi everyone! I worked in Qatar on April 2006 up to October 2009. I went to vacation with re-entry visa but did not come back. I dont have NOC and final exit visa. It is already 2 years & 3 months ago. I got a job offer now in Qatar.	I think there is a small catch here though. what if his employer realized that he is absconding and put a ban on him in feb 2010 instead of applying for a ban immediately ??? to be on the safer side; you can count 2 years from the date of your visa expired.	0

When your sponsors were told that you were not coming back from holiday; they would have proceeded quickly with cancelling your visa as they needed your visa free to allocate to somebody else. Companies have a certain number of visas allocated of certain nationalities and to replace a worker they have to cancel his visa; apply the ban and then reissue the visa to (in this case) your replacement. You can be safe to come back. As for the advise you are getting from others like flor; they should do their homework first instead of posting about subjects they know NOTHING about!!!	0

No News yet from the embassy; however there is a pre-requisite from this year; you have show your hotel bookings both in Makkah and Madinah before you leave as told by my agent. What is this?

Can anyone help or suggest anything?	Salaam Everyone; Very Sad to hear about this; My parents are here on visit and now they cant come with us for Umrah by Road or Air.	Brother don't worry and contact the respective agents of your after couple of week. As per some agents in Qatar initially embassy issue the visa only for the locals & residence of Qatar & after one to two weeks Saudi Embassy will start issuing the visa for the family those who are on Visit. I am also waiting to get the response from the agents but even I heard we need to give them the prior hotel booking to get the visa; this is applicable for those who just need Umra Visa. Those who are going through Agents using their transportation & accommodation doesn't required to show the hotel booking. Lets pray for Allah to may everything easy for all of us. Aamin	1

Are there any other girls that stay at home? Where are you from? How old are you? Do you have kids? How many? Their age? How long have u been in Doha? What do you do to keep urself busy and entertained? Any special place you go to often?	Hey there.. I had a work vs stay at home dilemma that ended up staying at home as a final decision as my son is only 4.5 months old and maybe will go back to work once he is older. Would like to meet all of you!!	Where are you from? I am from Lebanon How old are you? Am 27 Do you have kids? How many? Their age? I have a baby boy who will turn 5 months in a week How long have u been in Doha? For 4 years What do you do to keep urself busy and entertained? Humm; going out to malls; parks; see some friends even though I dont have many and thats why I would like to meet others. Any special place you go to often? Nope!!!!!!!! Just wanted to add that I have been working since I came to Doha; and have been off the workplace for a year now. I started a job a while ago; but my son got REALLY sick and we decided that he was way too young for daycares and we decided to stay with him until he is older. Staying at home makes me go stir crazy; but sometimes we have to sacrifice for our little ones. And this is what we intend to do. Anyone out there?????????????????? HELLO!!!!!!!!!! :)	1

Most of my friends are stay @ home moms with their kids and they go insane doing nothing; and whats worse is that they have no cars and wait for us single girls to pick them up! What makes me go insane is that i have to keep up with their kids (in malls) as they want me to see how crazy they go and don't want me to stay calm all the time!! (Torture) Anyways i suggest you make a group or something so u can all drink coffee while we work and be gloomy!	0

What makes me go insane is that they call all the time and want me to go do something with them. Don't they know I have a husband who I would rather do something with and darling; well behaved children that I love. (Torture to listen to the single girls whine) Anyways I suggest they make a group or something so that they can all drink coffee and complain about their lives. See- that wasn't a very nice post was it. Suzan--there are a ton of groups out there for moms and kids. Buy a copy of the Marhaba from the grocery store; skim through the listings; and pick the one that sounds like it fits you best. Good luck	1

Another suggestion is to use your time to learn how to build kids up by referring to books; good tv programs; expert opinions and so on. You have a little hope growing bigger each day; it is you who can direct that hope to be something in the future.. Lebanese are usually smart and he may become the new Lebanese president!

This question is a just a diversive way of saying that Filipinos do eat dog meat. Come on; look around and be good to people. asking a question that you know the answer is 5tup1d1ty.

A friend of mine lost his dog; when he searched for it other said it has gone to stomach of neighbor filipino. ; so I began enquiring about it and an filipino engineer told me the dog meat is extra special meal for our wedding ceremonies.	Vma; in Nagaland(India); they feed the dog some spicy food and then force it to wash it down with some strong alcoholic liquer. Then they take the dog by the tail and give it a vigorous swing and shake it until it becomes sick and throw up. They collect the vomit and leave the dog alone and the vomit is used as a topping for a very special rice dish during ceremonial feasts. And BTW; they eat dogs;crows;rats etc in some parts of the north east too. So "dog meat curry" and "dog puke" is an Indian dish. I have heard that other Asians like a some Koreans(not all) and some Japanese eat "dog meat" too. Exotic food is popular in many Asian country. But Filipinos do it "field rats" and "snake meat"; if I am not wrong!	0

I am INDIAN; and agree with Carlester ... it was a indirect question "Does Philipinos eat dot meat".. there are lots of stories going around the way Filipinos eat. Can someone put some light...which are the meat popular in Philipines..( apart from chicken; mutton; beef; pork ) it may clear lots of doubts ( including mine ! )	0

I think you are getting confused with Pig. Pig is served on Philipino weddings. Dogs are not eaten by Filipinos as far as I know. Curry is an Indian dish not a flilipino dish..	1

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL?

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0
Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids. The sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee's bank account.	There was a meeting held at Philippine embassy last week and they tackled about this matter. One of the requirements in submitting agreements in embassy is Labor contract signed by the sponsor indicating the salary of $400. We are still waiting for the confirmation of the additional requirement. Once the labor contract will be attached to the housemaid's agreement; the indicated salary will be implemented.	1

Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids. The sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee's bank account.	When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250. In the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid sends home 95 % of her salary - I remit it myself to her mothers account. She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home	0

Most of the play areas (Jungle Zone; Extreme world; Rays Reef) will do parties and I think you can specify food arrangements although most use the FF outlets. Other than that; hotels will let you use function rooms to have parties; some will also source mini discos etc. Try also Dana Club; Diplomatic Club etc. Depending on how large your party is; other ideas include; picnics; trips to the zoo; ice skating (older kids) Although you are providing the supervision and entertainment. Hope this helps.	1

watz happening can anyone suggest me?	I dont know what is happening to all my inhouse plants . they just wont survive. I changed manure; but in vain. put them in sunlight. gave them ventilation tried all tactics but they would just die away. turn black.	Make sure you don't use to small or too large a pot for your house plants; I have kept plants in their same container for 10 years and they are fine depends on the plant.  Also you mentioned manure; you don't use manure on indoor plants; I hope you meant soil. I also use a liquid fertilizer once in a  while and I save water bottles and fill with water and leave for my house plants that way the chlorine goes out and the temp is room temperature when you water once a week.  Sometimes the plants you get here are not good quality when you buy them so it doesn't take much to kill them.  I had gardenias in the house and within a few months they had outgrown the pot; root bound so I planted them outside in a big pot and they are great now. There is a garden club here you can join and get help and then you will know what plants are easy to grow; like the spider plant cleans your air so its good to have as a house plant.	1

The promotion probably started a day after your installation; or ended a day before. Even if you prove it; and convince them; QTel doesn't do refunds; they'll keep it in your account for that service.	1

Sorry guy for posting again. I am using Mozaic TV+ which was taken during the promotional period. I am paying only QR. 250/- per month. I dont think there are hidden charges for QTEL Services. It will be better you call QTEL and inform them about it. They will ask you to pay the bill completely and will give you a credit for the difference which will be adjusted in your next bill.	1

I called q-tel they told to me if you don't have land line then will pay landline installation charge.but in the qtel site clearly specified all installation is free. i cut from site that words below. Today Qtel unveil Mozaic TV+ service as part of its summer promotion series with substantial discounts for families to entertain themselves while at home.

And also in advertisement they specified for more information call 111. then i called this number and asked about the landline installation they told to me all installation charge is free including landline also. yesturday my friend called this number; again they told like that. then why they charged landline installation charge?. if they charged installation charge then should get all fecilities like: international and mobile calls also. but i got only landline to landline only. at the application time they didin't ask for which fecilities you needed?. thatmeans this telephone include this package.125 digital TV channels Basic channels + Additional channels( 2 month free) + 512 MB speed network connection + home telephone( landline to landline).	0

Dear Friends; My son; who is working here on my sponsorship; will be in Doha while I would be outside Qatar on my leave.	Can you please elaborate further on getting the multiple exit permits?

Dear Friends; My son; who is working here on my sponsorship; will be in Doha while I would be outside Qatar on my leave.	You just go down to immigration in Al gharaffa or the airport office with your ID and your sons Id and passport and ask for a multiple exit permit for 1 year. My husband has one and it is so easy.you then pay a fee and Voila. No problems! You have your get out of jail free card anytime you want within that year.	1

Dear Friends; My son; who is working here on my sponsorship; will be in Doha while I would be outside Qatar on my leave.	Alexam is wrong. Perhaps he doesn't have male children above 18 yrs old. My advise is to get a multi exit permit; which cost you only QAR 500; but saves you a ton of headache. No need for any form to fill; just take your son's passport; your ID; and go to the airport immigration dept; and make sure to clearly ask for multiple-exit permit option to the person processing your request.	1

Dear Friends; My son; who is working here on my sponsorship; will be in Doha while I would be outside Qatar on my leave.	You've mentioned that your Son is under your sponsoship right. It means that he should be having a family visa. Then; he won't require an exit permit for that. He can leave Doha whenever he wants. He just need to come back before 6 months is over; otherwise his visa will get forfeited...	1

Do not underestimate others; Qatar has highest food standard than any other EU or american countries; with almost 1000's of samples are being analysed for chemicals; radiologicals and microbiological quality.

Well; I remember this happening around my place last year & my dad had to literally go out and shout at them. U can just get the supervisor's contact number from those workers and speak to him regarding this. They are actually not permitted to work in residential areas at odd hours (23.00hrs - 5.00hrs). Just speak to him and tell him its not tolerable since u have school going kids at home and if it continues then u would complain to the higher authorities. Good Luck!!!	1

I would suggest that you boil the tap water and use for drinking or run the tap water through a filtration process system such as Aqua Guard or Brittanica. Agents are here in Doha who would give you a demonstration and I understand the system costs you around 2000riyals but you have the liberty to pay in installments. But I have seen the demonstration and you would see the difference what a tap water or mineral water (any brand) offers. The results are amazing and am sure that you would forget all this mineral water and opt for this system. Unfortunately I dont ahve th nos. of these filtration company agent personnel numbers. whenever I get it; I shall surely post it . cheers Bob.	0

Have you noticed this ?"	Government planned to enforce a law to put curbs on greedy landlords; it should act now "". Rightly said by H E Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah Because i was going through the classifieds for renting a house. Surprised to see that the rents started increasing.	This would be temporary as there is an oversupply of 2bhk/3bhk apts in the market. This is on account of the result of the Bid but once there are no takers at high rents; they would come down. The FIFA World Cup would take place in 2022. All stadium related development would take place only at a later stage. Other infrastructure development was anyways planned (although handover dates would be preponed). Premium villa’s (west bay lagoon area) might be a shortage and hence the rents might go up. Ultimately rents depend on the demand and supply of accommodation. Do not compare this to the Asian Games in 2006 – that was a different scenario. There was limited accommodation available and the apts that were available were of poor quality. Hence the rents shot up as people had no choice and there were takers at any price.	1

Does a Nissan have better resale than Kia?	Thanks for earlier responses.	Well; i would go for neither of them; as both of those companies have low resale values. It is true that Nissan has higher resale value than Kia; but both of them have low. As someone said; that a car doesn't matter as long as you like it; but you also need to look after the resale value. The two companies with the highest resale value are Honda and Toyota.

But If you hope to live alone you will be able to save some money. I wish you all the best!	1

I know its a new school; but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow American or British curriculum?	We are relocating from South Africa in July and I have literally applied to all the British and American schools for my 4 years son and been refused by each of them. We have however been lucky to get a spot at ACS Doha.	As you say; it's a new school; so it's difficult to confirm anything! I believe the buildings are not yet 100% complete ... but it's nothing for you to worry about; since the school year will only start in September.

They are well-established in the UK - you can see their website here http://www.acs-schools.com/acs-doha.aspx I have toured the campus and have to say it's quite impressive. My son is at Compass; which I am quite happy with; but you won't go wrong with ACS-Doha either. Here's some info from their website: The Programme Initially we will be offering our prestigious Early Years; Lower School; and Middle School curriculums; based on globally recognised American and international standards; with an aim to deliver the same range of academic programmes successfully offered at our three UK campuses [learn more]. As the campus develops a High School we will also seek authorisation to offer prestigious US College Board Advanced Placement (AP) courses.

Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types. Remember; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers. There are still many good schools where your child will much happier. Take Sherborne which is a very good school in the UK I hear but here in Qatar it is suffering from the same problem I mentined above!	0

For you information children learn first and foremost from their parents and taking into consideration your highly critical letter I am trying to picture your children; if you have any of course.

I am not sure about this agent whether this is a fake or real? Please tell me if this is ok to go ahead with such an offer? or Is there any place where I can verify about this agent Thanks in advance	Hi; I have been offered a 3 BHK flat for QR 4500 but the rentals should be paid in one year advance which is about QR 54000.	Bro; My piece of advice ; advance rental payment of 1 year is not practical and very risky. I highly suggest that you look somewhere else. There are a lot of flats and villas right now being offered by the owner itself and not those filthy; good for nothing; boot-licking; single cell; blood-sucking and parasitic real estate agents. Ahhh ; that is much better. Cheers;	1

Please dont risk that. My husband & i entered a similar deal; the landlord walked in on us saying he had cancelled his contarct with the agent and was asking us to retrieve our money and deal directly with him. We had trusted that the agent was working on teh landlors asignement & had even comfirmed this with contracts signed by the two. We are still struggling to get our money back from the agent & in the mean time the lanlord wants his pay so badly. Dont even think abt it. Pay monthly or simply give post dated cheques...

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL?

Have questioned my decision myself quite a lot of time but I am happy and so is my family. So that's all that matters in the end :-) Sorry for the little hijack.	0

A villa might sound to be big; but; how many are to share the villa ? And who is paying for your air travel ? Shared accomodation = shared food + shared communication expenses + shared expense over sightseeing or going out. Hmmph...While everyone is entitled to his/her own views; my view is that your package is a tad low and you have to really think through to save something. Cheers	1
Can i visit Dubai without an exit permit;Â  i know i cant come to South Africa with out a permit??? ?	Hello everyone; i am coming to Doha soon from South Africa and i beleive that once i am there i need an exit permit to leave; does anyone know what this means.	Your biggest problem being you have a south african passport my friend is in the same boat! If you are on a business visa then the answer is yes if you want to leave the country you HAVE to have a exit visa if you are on a visit visa then no you do not but you will need a visa to get into Dubai!	1

Hello everyone; i am coming to Doha soon from South Africa and i beleive that once i am there i need an exit permit to leave; does anyone know what this means.	you only need an exit permit once you have got a Residence Permit (RP).

So you will be on a business visa until your RP comes through all you have to do is tell your company when you are going and they will apply for a exit visa which is just a piece of paper really saying you are allowed to go and they will also get you the entrance visa for when you come back! You can go wher you like just remember to check if you need a visa for the other countries you wish to visit! Also make sure they have done your business visa before you fly out so it is sorted for when you land!	1

Can someone share; suggest or recommend any kind of treatment?	My mother suffers from rheumatoid arthritis and have undergone many treatments including ayurvedic; acupuncture and homeopathy but none gave permanent resoluations. She's 54.	No cure; but there are ways to minimize the symptions and lesson the damage to the joints. I see a R.A. doctor at Hamad regularly. I am so much better after having started Humira injections every two weeks. I also regularly take methotrexate (once a week). I had been on prednisone but have weaned myself off of that; thank goodness; but at the time; I really needed it. It was the first thing that ever helped me. I call it a miracle drug. Without these medications I was a basketcase. NOw I am fine. I have regular blood tests every 4 to 8 weeks to keep an eye on any problems arising from the medications. My RA was diagnosed in Nov 2008. Good luck!!	1
Can someone share; suggest or recommend any kind of treatment?

There is no known cure for rheumatoid arthritis; but many different types of treatment can alleviate symptoms and modify the disease process. Alleviating the current symptoms; and preventing the future destruction of the joints with the resulting handicap if the disease is left unchecked. RA should generally be treated with at least one specific anti-rheumatic medication. <a href="http://www.fitnesshealthzone.com/yoga/top-10-yoga-poses-for-relieving-headaches-and-shoulder-pain/">yoga poses</a>	1

Brother don't worry and contact the respective agents of your after couple of week.

I am also waiting to get the response from the agents but even I heard we need to give them the prior hotel booking to get the visa; this is applicable for those who just need Umra Visa. Those who are going through Agents using their transportation & accommodation doesn't required to show the hotel booking. Lets pray for Allah to may everything easy for all of us. Aamin	1

Is there any official statistics about increment of prices in Qatar? Something official statistics agency; Central Bank of Qatar or similar?	Discussing with my company regarding annual increment of allowance.	there has been much press lately about the drop in prices; food; and especially housing prices have been decreasing. So if you bring up a need for an increase in your allowances and salary right now; you probably won't get very far; maybe even have allowances decreased! There is something called the Qatar Statistics Authority at http://www.qsa.gov.qa/eng/index.htm May be helpful; but not sure. The English spelling in their reports is atrocious; they even spell literacy wrong! Makes me wonder about errors in their methodologies and data collection if they can't get even that right.	1
Is there any official statistics about increment of prices in Qatar? Something official statistics agency; Central Bank of Qatar or similar?	Discussing with my company regarding annual increment of allowance.	well; discussion has to be based in something with an official "smell".

Lets talk next year :) War looking for peace; is like fornication looking for virginity.	1

can somebody help?	i would like to know; how to enter; pass and exit a roundabout in qatar. i heard different versions from different driving schools and seen more different styles.	Remember this rule of thumb: always occupy your legal spot. Vehicles exiting from the roundabout have the right of way; so not much of a problem unless you're on the wrong side. Position your vehicle towards your point of exit: left if you're going to the left or taking a u-turn; right if you're going to the right; and center if you're going straight. Now for small round-abouts- like the one at The Center- your signal light spells a big difference. Just signal your intention so that other vehicles can give way to you. Hope this was of help. Drive safe! :)	1

Can anybody help me how to do that and where to apply?	I recently got married and I want to change my last name to my husband's last name.	LP.. its not hard at all if one knows to live correctly as muslim; after knowing true facts about islamic jurisprudance...n know exactly the reasons anything might be prohibited...in this case with regards to the name addition;its all misconceived perceptions of poorly informed people who say its prohibited... i suggest before concluding something which might perhaps be offensive to some other people you should think twice weather to say something or not...after all its a mixed socity with so many people from differnt faiths and thinking...wasnt this taught to you ever to be thoughtful and to be considerate at peoples feelings..	0

A particular group of people sagregating themselves is not same as racism. Indians overall are very kind people and refrain themselves from abusing anybody physically or mentally. Although; they may cheat you for money. Origin of racism is from stupidities like unnecessarily being rude to people; making foolish choices in business to favour a certain community wherein the candidate is less competant; not allowing people of a certain ethnicity not to enter a market wherein he could be a potential customer. Westerners are more racist than Arabs are. The only difference is they are not as foolish. And whatever else Indians are; but they are also not fools.	1

Yes it is casteism. But is some ways it can be called as "Racism" since we can called these indians belonged to different "tribes" whose religion; ethnicity and beliefs differs to each other. I also believe; elsewhere in the world; it is how the individual accepts the "new" culture where they were "in". If they lives and persists their own belief and the locals oppose to it...then they will cry out loud...saying that it is "racism"...	1

Hello; and thank you for your replies. I am still in the process so I don't have all of the particulars yet; but I was told I would be housed in Education City.

Expats applying for residency in the UAE will be tested on their knowledge of local cultures and traditions; the Federal National Council said on Monday; adding further hurdles for foreigners planning to work in the oil-rich nation. "Too many people don't know anything about our culture - there are many nationalities - and every resident needs to know something about this country;" Ahmed Shabeeb al-Dhahiri; first deputy speaker of the Federal National Council; told UAE daily Khaleej Times. Expatriates account for more than 80 percent of the population of the UAE; which relies on foreign workers to fuel its economy. But the number of expats is predicted to decrease as people working in construction and real estate lose their jobs and return home. Dhanin said a committee; which will be made up of members of various ministries; would be set up by October to create strategies to improve expats' understanding of the country; the newspaper reported on Tuesday.

I agree with GIASI; I owned a Nissan in Dubai and it was a pleasure to own it...However the dealership and Service of Nissan in Qatar is Horrible..

IF YOU HAVE THE MISFORTUNE OF A DENT ON YOUR CAR..IT WILL TAKE A WEEK FOR THEM TO REPAIR IT... WHY SELL CARS IF YOU CANT SERVICE THEM??

I'm using Al Manhal and the water sodium is medium; and the taste is not bad. Once a week delivery though unless you call (they will delivery 1-2 more depending on how low your family is). Their prices are the same as taking an empty container to the market and dragging a full one back; but delivered to your door! My roommate also uses Wataniya; which for the first month is super service; multiple times a week. Then seems to not be so super. But that could be that they changed to one to two times a week delivery and my roommate never knew (he also puts them out too late when most of the service starts 6-8am). The differences between the two is Al Manhal sometimes delivers leaking overused bottles; and Wataniya's bottles almost 100% look brand new. Wataniya's taste isn't quite as good as Al Manhal's but still not bad at all.	1

Texas A&M has pretty odd requirements as compare to others. Last time when i applied & got rejected; they asked me bring references & letter from two professional people who knows me. What you can do is call the registration office & ask them the reason why. Colleges & Universities ALWAYS gives a reason for rejection. A word of advice; stay away from CNAQ.

Some US universities have very stringent requirements. This application may be one of several hundred rejected just because they have filled all available spaces in a particular program. Have the various certificates/degrees presented been attested? Many Western universities look very carefully at degrees/certificates from outside North America and even Europe because there are a significant number of forgeries (not saying that this is the case here). The problem in this application is probably that they didn't apply in time and so were not on the first pick list. Signature line > "You can't fix stupid"	1

Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids.

One of the requirements in submitting agreements in embassy is Labor contract signed by the sponsor indicating the salary of $400.

Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids.

When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250. In the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid sends home 95 % of her salary - I remit it myself to her mothers account. She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home	0

I need a good quality and good brand? Dell;Toshiba; HP???? ?	I would like to buy a laptop for my personal use. Any suggestions which brand of laptop is good.	There are several considerations in buying laptops and here are some of the basics.. Looks - definitely you want to have a laptop which can be mistakenly recognized as an old one; so you have to select which is the most updated and stylish in terms of appearance. Right now; most laptops are getting thinner compared to their predecessors. Also; a laptop which is small in terms of screen width (14 inches below)is so stylish and more handy. Any brand of laptop can be as stylish as is seems depending on your taste. Battery Life - this is also a major consideration in buying laptops. It also creates a lot of inconvenience if your laptop battery last for short periods only. In my experience HP laptop batteries are far better from any brand. Just always remember that when you are charging your battery; unplug the cable once it is fully charged. If you are going to use your laptop for a longer period of time; it's better if you plug the laptop to a regulated power supply and detach your battery from the laptop. The first two are basic considerations. Below points are dependent on your applications the laptop shall be subjected once it is in operation. Applications are graphic designs; web-designs; softwares; chatting; gaming; audio and video; emails and web-browsing; etc. Processor - buy laptop with a minimum of 2.0 GHz speed for better outputs of your applications. Graphics - if you want good graphics; select a laptop with G-Force in it. Operating systems - Vista and its predecessor; XP is really far from each other. Although all new laptops are basically equipped with Vista OS; try on having two OS's like XP on one drive and Vista on the other (Dualboot); so you can be more flexible. RAM and HDD - random access memory (RAM) and hard disk drive (HDD) are also to be considered if you want higher applications. Anyway laptops right now are arriving at 2GB RAM and 250 HDD at minimums. Hope I'd helped you on selecting a laptop. Basically; we cannot really say what laptop is the best; it depends on your preferred application usage.	1

Any experiences with other gyms or other workout groups etc?"	Sigh - what a disappointment. Even the classes are separated so you gotta look our for ""female only"" spin or whatever.

What is the basic salary for a Filipino maid if I hire through an agency?	I tried searching on this topic; but I falied to find an answer.	There is minimum salary by contract- 700 QR.. But you must give her a nice room to live in and bathroom; kitchen she can use; food and any medical help ( if she needs); hala card and mobile ( if she doesn't have) and money monthly (or how you want) for mobile credit;she must keep in touch with her family. And of course to provide with such things like soap; shampoo etc But 700 QR is really nothing for that hard job what they are doing.. so; increase it..	1

can we used this to get a visit visa for her? What are our options?	To all my fellow Filipinos please advice. . I just asked my wife; she said it will take time for us to get a NSO authenticated marriage certificate; we only have the original marriage certificate from our Local civil registrar. . .	Applying for an NSO authenticated MC only takes 1 week; and if you applied for a visa; will take you another week; plus translation in the Embassy will take you roughly 1 week. So; what's the rush? Ministry of Interior will ask you to get the stamp from the Embassy; and in order for you to get that from our embassy; it needs to be from the NSO. If you're really in a hurry; buy a business visa; or book her in a hotel and get the 1 month tourist visa. If you want the 6 month family visit; you need the proper document.	1

I have yet to take a rdie in one of these new franchised taxis. So I don't know about their services. Wonder whether Mowasalat had made any effort to oversee complaints regarding Al Million in order to further enhance the quality of service.	I've tried Al Million Taxi so far it was a good experience. The taxi was on time; there was a text from them prior to the agreed time and the name of the driver with the plates. The meter was on and the destination was plotted in their metering machine. But yes since the driver was new he was'nt familiar with where I was going so I have to tell the directions. Other than that I have no problem with getting a taxi from them!	1

Better service than regular Karwa.. drivers are well behaved & much better..only hing..they just need some time to get familiar with all the routes in the city..rest all is good.	1

Wonder whether Mowasalat had made any effort to oversee complaints regarding Al Million in order to further enhance the quality of service.	I wanted to talk about this topic anyway. Yesterday I took a Million cab from Lulu to just two signals away(Near Falcon Petrol Station). He did'nt know where mall round about is. He did'nt know how to change lanes. The lady behind honked like hell and showed her sour face through the window. Somehow I managed to reach my house..I feel pity for these drivers as they are very new to this place and desperate to make a living. Hope it goes well after sometime without too many casualities... The taxi was new and clean. The driver was courteous and very obliging.He only took 10 Riyals; where Karawa guys take 12- 15 Riyals. I welcome Million Taxi; with all its faults. Doha really needed a competitor for Karwa.	1

They show their respect to costumers not like the old karwa taxi drivers which are arrogant and this new million taxi; they are not choosing their costumers! They charged us an extra 4riyals because they had two meters running. one is always 4 riyals and the other one start at 4 riyals. This is way better than the ole Karwa Taxi's! i hope they'll maintain their good image though.	1

The only comment i can make is that last Friday morning from decoration roundabout towards the Ramada Juction; one decided that he would try and cut me up and flash lights/honk horn etc. Anyway his number plate should you wish to travel with the uneducated sod is 3203. I have passed this to the police; thought that it may be better for me in the long run instead of ripping the ba@$#&%s head off... happy motoring.	0

What is acceptable?"	My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told "long sleeves and long skirts". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro.....	1

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..	0

Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear "normal" clothes; this is totally acceptable for "western ladies". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela	1

I would like to know is this for all grade levels?... My son will be going to seventh grade will this be a problem??? ?	I have seen some comments about waiting lists for schools...	At the moment most schools are shut for the Summer - there may be a few schools where the Admin staff are still in. All grades are full in most schools. Most schools have very long waiting lists - however - come September there will be places because a lot won't come back from Summer holidays and some get 1st/2nd choice - leaving gaps in waiting lists.	1

I would like to know is this for all grade levels?... My son will be going to seventh grade will this be a problem??? ?	I have seen some comments about waiting lists for schools...	Places have been filled by now and waiting lists will have been updated. Schools are not back now until beginning of September (by that I mean school offices) and I am almost sure that whatever school you pick; you will be placed on the waiting list. Have a look at schools suitable to your 'requirements'; but be aware that the more waiting lists you join; the better chance you have to get a place. But first you need to get here as no school will give you a chance to even join the waiting list if you are not physically in Qatar.	1
I would like to know is this for all grade levels?... My son will be going to seventh grade will this be a problem??? ?	I have seen some comments about waiting lists for schools...	This is really late to be trying to find a place for September; try and get his name into as many schools as you're interested in ASAP - There is the ASD; DESS and Doha College which are all probably considered to be the best - but because they are good - their waiting lists can be long. Some have recommended Compass or Sherbourne as well. Do a little googling to see about facilities and contact info - then start communicating with them.	0
Do you think the depiction is exaggerated or is it actually accurate? How did you spend your April salary?	Life in Qatar can get expensive at times; especially if you have your family here.

Planning & budgeting in line with your earnings are more important. It doesnt mean that need to sqeeze your regular expenditures; but cut short more on purchases; every time think about your savings specially if you have kids. Cause for expats nothing is certain here; be prepared to meet any contingency's.	0

If this government take over all these vacant flats and rent it out then it would bring down the prices a lot. Nowadays what's happening is; neither villas are occupied nor rent is coming down..	1

Makes a big difference and got it done for QR1700 and in 45 minutes. Very friendly and I went back the next day as thought I had bubbles in the windscreen. Hate to say it but they were right as disappeared after a week. Good luck; I got ours because of a newborn as well. Now if only someone could invent something that turned on the air con in the car 5 minutes before you get would be a wonderful combination.	0

can i go with my car? because i have car loan with commercial bank?	I plan to go Makkah for Umrah on Feb or March Insha Allah.	Yes; you can go easily.

However; I travelled twice with my car which was taken through a loan; but no body in Abu Samrah borders ask me for this paper. God bless you. Pray for us in MAkkAH.	1

So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	Beauty is in the eye of the seer.	0
So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	I believe; the statement is completely true. The outward appearance of a person counts for nothing; but it is what lies beneath the skin. The actual person him/herself is what really matters. Imagine buying an apple; the plumpest; shiniest & ripest looking one in a supermarket; then; while biting into it; you find out that it is rotten and wormy.	1

So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	Beauty is only skin deep; but ugly goes straight to the bone.	1
So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	Sadly; this is a fact of life. We are attracted first to the external beauty before delving deeper.	1
So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	Well;I get attracted to people who are handsome but it's their personality/attitude that will make me be into that person.I always go for guys who are physically attractive but as I go deeper to know them it will come to a point that it's not only their physical attributes that I fell in love with but the person that they are. For me; No matter how handsome that person is if he cant make me happy and make me laugh more than anyone else could then it's not going to work. :)	1
So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	I firstly think most people are attracted to the outside appearance..You could meet the most hansom guy or prettiest girl but if they are ugly on the inside they become ugly on the outside also...Looks aren't everything;but that also comes with age you learn other things are more important in a person beside looks :)	1
So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	Eh. let me think methodically. If a rhinoceros's skin is really thick/deep; and if beauty is skin deep; then a rhino must be really beautiful :) I am off to a zoo with a red rose to propose to a rhino right now :D	0
So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	But thankfully beauty is in the eyes of the beholder so one man's(or woman's) beautiful can be another's turn off! Personally I believe everyone has what it takes to be beautiful but it's certain deeds; experiences; and circumstances than can mar a person's beauty.	1
So whats your opinion?	In this modern world; people judge you based on how you look while at the same time speak out that beauty is only skin deep.	Asinine Thinker Great! That means you are a rhinoceros... and uh! if you are not; i guess marrying a rhinoceros yield rhino-sapien babies (combination of rhinoceros and homo sapien). lol; I can't imagine the situation where your kids talk rhino language and their bodies are made up of rhino skin... and yeah; they will have a horn too! And guess what; you will love them because "beauty is skin deep". :D :P	0

Anyone can suggest me?	I am looking for the best fare flight from Doha to Houston; It is no need to be directly flight.	I've got a really good deal from Doha-Detroit-Doha for only 3200 QR.

But; you need to have a credit card which is issued by Canadian/US institution - that's the drawback of expedia & cheaptickets. Good luck	1
Anyone can suggest me?	I am looking for the best fare flight from Doha to Houston; It is no need to be directly flight.	best fare or best flight.... I once had a cheap KLM flight; through Amsterdam (a 24hour flight) I prefer the direct Qatar Airways flight (preferably in Business Class) It's a direct DOH-IAH 17h flight (10am to 5:30pm same day) the flight back is a 15h flight (7:45pm to 7:45pm next day) ... Timezone differences make the numbers seem illogical :)	1
Anyone can suggest me?	I am looking for the best fare flight from Doha to Houston; It is no need to be directly flight.	Like mentioned before; Qatar Airways is the best bet. A flight from Doha to Houston will be around 1400 usd depending on the time of year you go. For example; a flight near Christmas time would be a couple hundred dollars more expensive. I've searched taking a longer flight with layovers and it is always over a thousand more so it's sooo not worth it.	1

Who asked you to go for an MRI; that doctor can give a referral for hamad hospital; requesting a MRI. Appointment can take upto a month. I don't think it's necessary for the phc dr to give a referral or that you need to check again with a dr at hamad. I had a referral once directly from A private clinic for an MRI. but rules change. You can check with the dr you are following up your problem with; ask him or her for a referral and then go to hamad hospital X-ray MRI unit and check about the appointment. They are usually helpful; and if they appear uncooperative; please complain since their customer service takes such things seriously; but I don't think you will get such a problem. Their staff is usually helpful; sometimes it can take more than 3 staff members to give you the right picture but they will try and help you and guide you.	1

In order to get any service from HMC; you need a Health card. Alongwith the Health card; go with your private Doctor MRI referral to the Main HMC MRI section or Al-rumaila MRI section ang get the appointment. So simple. Best regards.	1

I'm new here so I am not quiet sure who ""my doctor"" is. Otherwise I have to pay around 1000QR at a private hospital; which is very expensive.	Secure a health card if you have not done so already by visiting the Health Center of your area with a pp size photograph and QR 100. (Of course you need to be an RP holder to be eligible) It might take a couple of days or even more to be with you. With that in hand visit your local health center again and see any GP with your complains; let him refer you to some specialist in Hamad related to your complain. Take an appointment of the specialist in Hamad. If luck is by your side and depending on the specialization you have been referred to; it might take somewhere between 1 to 6 months before you could see the specialist. Last time when I was there to take an appointment for evening clinic (not free even with health card); I was told that the appointment system itself is being upgraded and no appointment is possible until January next year. So watch out. Now if you are really lucky and you get to see the specialist and he feels that you need an MRI Scan done; he will issue you a paper .....	1

Hi flexicode; you can see a doctor at hamad without going through the health centre. I have had two appointments with different doctors and one for my family member; by directly asking for an appointment.ofcourse you don't get the appt immediately; depending upon the doctor; some specialists are available within a week's time; while renowned consultants have a std waiting period of 45 days; miss that appt and the next one is after another 45 days.grrrr;downside of waiting to meet a consultant is that if he is on a casual leave on the day of the appointment; they don't inform you and some junior dr will see you; beats the point of actually taking an appt with a consultant and then waiting to see him. It helps if you have a referral and a referral by a private dr should be fine too. Most important is to have a health card;once you have applied; they issue you a receipt; you can use the hospital services with the receipt.	1

I must add that they keep changing their rules so one month you can get an appt over the phone and the next month they would ask you to go to the phc first for a different appt. Moreover getting an MRI done outside could cost almost 1500 or more;depending upon the area being scanned. But it depends on how worried you are about your condition; and the cost is nothing; you get your results quickly; but if you can wait; its better to get into the national health care system; its not costly; and let them take care of you. Hope you feel well soon.	0

Firstly thank you all for the quick and informative responses. Nobody has actually ASKED me to get an MRI; but I want to do it myself as I am worried about my back. My lower back has been aching me for about 2 weeks now; and yesterday the upper right side of my back starting hurting. I visited a Doctor and he instantly told me that it is NOT a slipped disc; and is just a muscle spasm as the pain doesn't extend to my legs; though I still want to be certain as I want to start working out again; but I don't want to mess with my back if I shouldn't. And he said the upper back pain was also normal; and not related to a slipped disc whatsoever. Thanks again!	0

Your dr is right; if your pain is not extending to your limbs and are not feeling any pain or numbness in your fingers or toes; feet; then you don't need to worry. It's possible that you have injured yourself during your workout or is due to your work position; the way you sit at your desk; the way you sit while driving etc. Slip disc would give you excruciating pain; even simple tasks can become difficult; I am not sure if slip disc is the same as disc bulge; but in a disc bulge; if it starts touching the nerve; then you can have crazy tingling pain. You can try asking for an appointment with a dr.arun at hamad hospital in the evening clinic; or try to meet him at alkhor hospital. He is available in Doha only on Tuesday the other days; he is in alkhor.waiting time can be long; because he quite sought after. You can also meet dr.bhat at Doha clinic; he is one of the best and a longtimer in Doha. I would advice you to refrain from weight training.....	1

Hey han19; Thank you so much for the reply; and the advice. I feel so much better knowing that it hopefully most likely is NOT a slipped disc. Being so young; and having started a new career; it would really not be a good thing. I have stopped weight training completely for now which sucks; but do you think it would be a good idea to introduce it very mildly? You think jogging is okay? I want to meet a proper Doctor; even if at a private hospital; as the guy at Hamad was busy; and only barely gave me any advice. I am sure a proper doctor can give me advice as to how exactly the right position is to sleep; to sit; etc. Maybe can give me some exercises to do to help me recover faster. You know any Doctor; even at a private hospital you specifically would recommend? These problems are to do with the Radiology section is that right? Forgive me as I know VERY little about hospitals and such problems; as I have had very few problems in the past (touch wood). Thank you again	0

Hi Hmd; I would not advice you to do any strength training till you back pain subsides. Are you a heavy person. Brisk walking is preferred to jogging as in jogging you are putting a lot of impact on your lower back; as well as our knees. If you are a heavy person then you shuld try to avoid jogging n skipping.brisk walk is great again body posture is important. The stomach muscles support the back; so you need to firm up our stomach. A good physiotherapist can suggest some basic exercises; especially for the back and they really help. They are very simple; if you are into exercises u should know the cobra posture; cat stretch; simple leg lifts while lying down. For sitting position try to google office ergonomics and they usually have a standard picture that shows how one should be seated at an office desk. Wile driving; if you drive long distance; you need to move your neck frequently. You may call Doha Clinic hospital; and ask for Dr. Bhat; he is very good and his treatment is usuall.....	1
What is acceptable?"	My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told "long sleeves and long skirts". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter).

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..	0

Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear "normal" clothes; this is totally acceptable for "western ladies". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela	1

Tatanong lang po kung sino man sa mga kabayan natin ang nag Hongkong muna (nag tour man o hindi) tapos pumunta ng Qatar.	we came via hongkong; from phils me and my 4 yrs old son because of this st*&%&* people in qatar embassy in phils about rules and regulation they don't even know how to handle it. anyway; to cut the long story short. i leave them alone. i took a 3 days tour to hongkong and the time we arrive we just waited for out flight to qatar no question ask. you might be having problems in phils not hongkong. you have to armed yourself with a show money; accomdation vouchers; and all other kaikikan. i advice fly from subic airport more cheap. good luck. sorry to say these people making the rules; they don't even goes trial and error. for they are all waste of space and waste of time. why i say that because imagine telling me that we will go to qatar to work. while on my visa stated "HOUSEWIFE" and my son is "CHILD". imaging how st£$%%% they are???? hinanapan ba naman ng profession yun 4 yrs old. Nakakaloka.....	1

Thank you so much Anna ; Rizks and Babesphil... that's what my friend is going to do. He will be leaving in the Philippines for Hongkong for a tour purpose. He will be staying there for 3 days to consume his tour package. After 3 days he will be taking a flight to Doha. My follow-up question is that; is it convenient to just purchase a ticket there in Hongkong bound for Doha since it's cheaper I guess or I'll just buy for him a ticket here where I purchased his tourist visa? And is it just ok if it's only a one way ticket (Hongkong-Doha)? Will the Hongkong immigration scrutinize this one way ticket? So sorry for asking too much as my friend is really worried same as me.	0

What do you fine citizens of QL think?	I work in the UK on a salary of 17;000GBP after tax. I have a feeling my company will be offering me a comparable salary to work in Qatar. This does not include any benefits; so i will have to pay for accomadation etc. I am a British citizen; 23 and single so i do not need anything too lavish.	No way near enough if you have to pay your own accomodation. check QL classifieds to get an idea of the going rate for apartments. EVERYTHING here is more expensive; except for petrol. You need to be making a good deal more than you were in the UK.	1

A decent single bed apartment cost 4000 to 5000..whats left? for a car you will have to pay 2000 per month.. so its too less... <a href="http://s434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/?action=view&current=0003.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://i434.photobucket.com/albums/qq67/formattedsoul/0003.gif" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a>	1

This does not include any benefits; so i will have to pay for accomadation etc. I am a British citizen; 23 and single so i do not need anything too lavish.	Just to give you a brief idea about living costs in Qatar; take a good look at these facts: 1- Rent of a 1 bedroom apartment in a mid-class area is from 3;500 up to 4;500 QAR per month. Sharing an apartment with someone else may save you around 1;000-1;500 QAR per month. 2- Renting a small car (1500 cc) is around 1;500-1;700 QAR per month. 3- Food costs for a single per month are around 800-1;500 QAR depending on what you eat and drink. The previous number increments if you drink alcohol. 4- Going out on weekends costs around 200-300 QAR depending on what you do (that's about 800-900 QAR per month). 5- Water and electricity bills are around 300 QAR per month. Any extra services like mobile and internet are at about 250 QAR each (that's another 500 QAR per month). Need I continue...?! I don't think so. ********************************* <b> <i> Obstacles are what you see when you set your eyes off the goal.	1

I have also spent my bachelor life for few years in Doha and believe me It was worst phase of my life. . So I would say to our brother INDIANCHAP that he should do his level best to bring his family in Qatar otherwise he will be banging his head on the walls. . 1. Souq Waqif [go with decent clothes on Thursday night;Friday & Saturday nights too] 2. Almost all Malls [go with <b>extremely</b> decent clothes] as i have seen those security guards they always stop labourers with untidy clothes (or) no sense of clothing at all. 3. Souq Area for Shopping 4. Musheirib Area to meet more of your bachelor friends if you visit it on THURSDAY & FRIDAY NIGHTS. 5. Become a "member" of any CLUB if you're earning very good salary. _______________________________________________________ <strong>"A winner listens; a loser just waits untill it is their turn to talk"</strong>	1

I only wish to work a few hours a week - how do I do this legally?	I am under my husband's sponsorship but wish to offer music lessons to the public as a self employed music teacher from my home.	It is quite common here in Qatar; running private tution classes; music classes; musical instruments training; baby sitting at home etc. etc.. for this case you can do it at home unless someone run out from your building after hear your song!!; When group of children gather together to learn music; and sing together make sure it will not disturb your neighbors and they complain; I love music; I love songs; I use to sing but a not professional singer.	0

where can i get Nicotine Patch in Doha? Is there any prescription require from Doctor? Is there any other alternative available?	I want to quit smoking. If somebody is also in therapy then please share your experience.	My Frnd; The basic failure to quit smoking is firmness. People wants to quit smoking not because they wish; but because it is injures to health. If you really wish from your bottom of heart; then chances to quit smoking is more. But if is because someone is insisting or due to health reason; then you may really need more efforts. I wish you success. Does the QL members agree on the aove point.	0

I would like to be able to get Champix/Chantix; the quit smoking pill. Many of my family have taken it and quit completely. It blocks your craving for nicotine and you no longer want or need to smoke. I have asked many times if it is available here and never got an answer.	1

I've accepted a teaching job with the Ta'allum group. Don't know which school yet.	Well; Al Jazeera and Al Maha Academies don't have the best reputations in Doha but most teachers survive there for a year. I wouldn't be too surprised at no information. It is Ramadan and in Qatar things happen on their own time. Mandi	1

My Australian friend came here to Doha under the Talum scheme... they did NOT look after her or her 2 children. Many people complain about Talum. The Al Maha School is very tight Muslim school and the people I know that work there as teachers are NOT happy. Don't know about the other school. They promise much and deliver little. My friend was paid 10;000 Qatar Riyals along with accommodation which was well below standard!!! Find some other agency but don't deal with them!!!! My friend finally got her children home to Australia after terrible expense and trouble. You cannot get out easily once you get here!!!! You have to apply for an exit visa and if you signed a 2 yr contract you are bound to stay whether you like it or not!!!! I hope you see this in time... FORGET IT!!!! :(	1

Ice Maiden; That's so similar to my story. Its been a year for me as a stay home mommy and this will be same for next 6 months and then we will leave Qatar so that I can continue working. I stayed home for all this time here just so that we could stay together as a family while hubby completes his assignments here. Have questioned my decision myself quite a lot of time but I am happy and so is my family. So that's all that matters in the end :-) Sorry for the little hijack.	0

Hi; You could try the Lake District in the UK; I have found the best places are Coniston; Kendal and Windermere. I used to go with my wife and kids at least three times a year. Weather should be ok that time of year; and it is fantastic for walks; and very safe for children. If you hired a car you could drive round the different villages and stay in a different B&B or Guest House every night if you wanted; so there would be plenty of variety.	1

It is slightly cheaper than the rest of Europe. It has a beautiful landscape and has loads of historic architecture. The Vienna zoo is one of the best zoos in the world.

Why can't Doha; a seaside capital city of an aspiring tourism hub not have at least ONE beach? Does anyone know any good beaches near the city limits?	Damn...The beach besides the Intercontinental has been closed. The area has been set aside for a housing project. It was so popular amongst the residents.

Has anyone else heard this and have any info?? ?	I heard rumors of a new American based curriculum school coming to Doha.

Compass promised to be an "International School" but it plainly Enlgish. It is accredited by the New England association of Schools and colleges; so that somewhat reassures me. Now the big question- will it compete with ASD; take the kids who can't pass ASD's assesment or be even better than ASD??	0
Has anyone else heard this and have any info?? ?	I heard rumors of a new American based curriculum school coming to Doha. I also just recently took a survey asking me questions about what I would like to see in a new school.	I'm 99.9% sure that it is actually an American school that runs campuses overseas. ASD obviously has the best facilities out there; but for me that's not what's important. I would be surprised if any school can give ASD a run for their money on that front; but I'm sure it will do well barring any major problems with the school as a whole. The Compass curriculum is based on International Primary Curriculum. There are definitely elements of the British Curriculum in there; but it's not an "English" school. (It's working great for us; in fact - they've done a great job with our son; who has "differences".)	1

However; I am surprised to find so many women not wearing them. Is there a need as long as I am dressed conservatively; or are those not wearing them being disrespectful and simply tolerated?	My family and I are new here. I packed lightly for my stay; with the intent to purchase a burqa for my outings; out of respect for the culture.	Hi Go as per what your mind says.	1

You didn't realise yet that Qatar; sorrily; is a step away from Dubai (or may be Egypt) where you seldomly meet a woman with Niqab (Burqa) It's worthy to express gratitude for respecting the land traditions.	1

During my short visit I got the impression that Muslim or not; it's each individual's decision (or sometimes her family's or community's decision) and if no veil is chosen (whether for the hair alone/hijab or hair and face/burka/niqab) that modest dress is ok.	1

Can anybody tell good advice?? ?	I am seeking an advice to those who have a wide experience on how I can settle my unpaid credit card since I had repatriated from the UAE. Please; this is a serious matter and tells me the most accurate action to do. Am afraid that in a sudden unavoidable occasion if I will be re-entering on that country; the interest is continuously rising. I have the will to pay but I don't know the procedure.	If its small amount you may can pay in lump sum. If not speak to the Credit & collection department of that particular bank & say that youre currently working in Qatar. (You may have to send the Appointment letter). That youre looking at option of settling the same and ask how to go about it. or you can speak to the local bank here in Qatar and issue a Standing order to transfer cash every month to your respective bank in UAE. If you do not wish bank to know that youre working here in Qatar. You can ask one of your relative or a friend (whom you can trust) to deposit on behalf of you to Credit Card account. You can remit cash every month to your friend in UAE	1

Once you will go to Airport same time they will take you to immigration jail Al Aweer you will be having a court next day; and after 15 days will be your sentence remember the pending payment is one hunderd or one hunderd thousand the punishment will be only 40 days only. and if its international bank like RBS; HSBC; Barclays then its not too strickt you can convence them but once its travel ban even bank can not remove till you will not pay. Go to online service of the bank send them mail comunicate with them they will give you solution even you are any where in the bank you can pay them. Best of luck..............!	0
What is acceptable?"	My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told "long sleeves and long skirts". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro.....	1

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..	0

Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear "normal" clothes; this is totally acceptable for "western ladies". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela	1

Hi Dear; Wishing you Happy New Year 2012. Yes you have been allotted with Visa but its still undergoing few formalities like Final Signature from Signing Authority and Security Clearance. You should go to immigration department and show them the application receipt. They will let you know the exact status. Once everything is done...the status will be changed to "Ready for Printing" and later you can get it printed either from MOI website or get the printed copy from Immigration Dept. Hope this answers your question. All The Best.	1

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	0

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

My kid was accepted there...I like their school facilities more than Newton(terrible!!! ); for example. But I have know idea about teaching there.	our kids were there last year; but we have transferred them to a cheaper and better school. Can't say where as 'someone' will work out who i am. Kids did ok; but were not at all challenged. Biggest issue is the student mix and the site. It's too small now (around 200 kids I understand); so they have lunch in the classroom and take turns at playing outside. Quality of ed. is basic. Owing to language difficulties; (loads of Dutch and Danes) it's lowest common denominator stuff. But if your kids are bright; even the schools that are 'closed' will interview and test. Ours are now going to one that has been full for 4 years; but we didn't have to wait as they did v well on the entrance exam. Hamdulillah. And the fees? As said above; "because they can"...	1

You often find that when Megamart get something new in they slap a ridiculously high price on it in the hope that people will just buy it (which we often do; clearly). But I've quite often seen that a few weeks later the price is drastically reduced; sometimes halved; presumably because not enough people were buying it at the ridiculous price.	1

I am An HR Manager; Since You Have not yet printed your visa; you have to leave the country and they new company will recruit you on a new visa (NO NOC Required). But do not make finger print; since they can make a RP for you. but what you are doing is a horrible thing since the company brought you from your country on their own expense and then you decided that you want to find another job (which is relatively easy here). Well its none of my business; but good luck	1

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	1

Fireheartin; look before you make such a big mistake of your life stop to reconsider this whole "giving up". What are you going to gain by giving up smoking? Live healthier? Live longer? lol these are all myths to giving up smoking just to make you feel better about yourself. Its not easy to give up smoking depending on how long you have been smoking. Also WHY! why put your body through such mental and physical stress to resist the urge to have that beautiful puff! let me list out a few advantages of smoking 1. Taking a crap in the morning is so much more relaxed and mentally soothing when your on the throne with a ciggie. Its just comes out better. 2. Say your the only guy who doesnt smoke and all your other friends smoke; you'll be looked as that "loser" guy. Your not a loser when you smoke; you make MORE friends when you smoke.

I was a smoker 5+ years ago.. Here are my experiences: 1- I use to smoke 1 packet a day and reduced gradually to 4 cigs a day hoping that I will break free. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 2- Tried smoking patches. It ran my throat dry and I felt like hypnotised. Bad remedy really. THIS APPROACH FAILED. 3- Determination. When I use to smoke; i leave the office to smoke and interrupt work; i make my car smelling cigarrets; it destroyed my health and i become like a dog after running for a minute or so. So I decided to stop smoking no matter what because I said to myself that all consequences and health issues that affect me from smoking have to stop. This solution WORKED!!! You have to convince yourself that you must stop. Don't fool urself thinking u r addicted and cannot stop. It is an addiction but you can live normally without it.

We can't decide if it's best to pay excess bagage and bring items like child port-a-cot and car seat with us or put in shipping.	Definitely phone the airline. The baggage rules have changed a LOT and we nearly got stung for US$525 for three bags earlier this month. As recently as October 2008 you could fly from the U.S. to Doha on Qatar Airways without the carseats counting toward your baggage requirement at all. In other words; you were allowed two bags per passenger. . .so if there were two adults and two (paying) kids then you were allowed eight bags PLUS the two car seats. But no longer. . .now you would be allowed six bags plus two car seats. Anything over that costs US$175 *per bag*. We learned this the hard way; so it's not an urban legend for us :(	1

I am not aware of any companies that hire them out. Car seats; in particular; are generally not used outside of the expatriate crowd. :( You can find what you need at the City Center Babyshop store; but depending on your luggage situation it might just make sense to bring it with you.	1

Could you please help me with the following? 1) How your companies reacted to withholding taxes Thanks My Blessings.	Hi friends; I am working with an international company where the new income tax law is to be implemented.	u should understand the difference between withholding and actual taxes. As per the law which came in effect on 1/1/2010; for those companies that are doing work in the country without being registered / don't have CR/ the owner of the contract will withhold either 5% or 7% (depends on the activity)of the total payment on monthly basis. This amount will be paid to the tax authority before the 15th of the following month. In my opinion; this is to encourage foreign companies to establish a base office in the country.	1

The issue would be not with your gender but with your visa. Since you're on the visit visa you need to find job/company that will provide with the residence permit before your current visa expires or else a fine of 200QR/day for overstaying. Good Luck!	1

Normally the ban period in case of resignation & cancellation of VISA is 2yrs... 2. But incase of your wife; she can ask from her company to issue NOC to her stating that her company won't object while she transfers her company visa to husband visa..There is no need for her to even exit QATAR.. Incase; if her company doesn't willing to give her NOC and no transfer of VISA; she can leave QATAR and can come back on HUSBAND VISA provided that you(husband)should meet all the norms and criteria that is normally required once applying for FAMILY VISA...You should be earning a salary of around QR7000 or more than that..	1

Its nothin to do with size n looks; it sure does with the money. Also I believe communication problem is there; usually u find the asians with good accent; I'm talkin as in majorities n minority.

'Easier catch'; 'expensive to keep'; whew! I wish you could have been more subtle here... Nobody is a 'good catch'; buddy. If you find someone who reciprocates your feelings; the question of being expensive doesnt arise. Chances are; one wouldnt let the other bear everything on their own.

How many Asian guys do you see over here; sheer weight of numbers; I would think. Ok but my fiancee thinks its because the asian girls here are more westernised and therefore would have more in common with them. Also there are alot of Asian Girls dating Asian Guys here; perhaps you just don't see them; trust me she is Korean and would know the numbers. Perhaps you don't notice an Asian/Asian couple but notice an Asian white match more because it sticks in your brain. I have seen loads of Fillipino Couples out together; and I am told that Fillipino girls would much rather go out with Fillipino boys here as they have more in common and are not just trated as sex objects which we know many Arab guys do.	1

Any advice out there?	Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	1

If you are not looking for a long time relationship; go for it... When it comes to a question of sex; Nationality / religion does not matter... that is my humble opinion. Angelo	1

I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX.

Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.	Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	1

Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Here I actually mean women from China; Phillipines and Thailand..Easy prey for western men..In other countries South Asia and Middle east women are not availabl.....	0

Why donÂ´t you date our friend here; Gineeshlee; he wants more than sex...or so it seems. Anyways; on a serious note. IÂ´ve seen too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately...and you know what; Qataries are much better behaved than that. At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut. If you behave like a lady; chances are that you might find someone that treats you like a lady.	1

Redcajun504; Is this your first time dating or dealing with Man ? Isn't it a fact that generally Man (of any Nationality) always try to get into Woman's pants ? You discuss this issue like you're from the Outer space ! If all this dating stuff are too complex for you & Sunny; my advice is go for "gineeshlee". He's the safest bet.	0
Has anyone else heard this and have any info?? ?	I heard rumors of a new American based curriculum school coming to Doha. I also just recently took a survey asking me questions about what I would like to see in a new school.	not sure if awfaz global school is what you are talking about but know it has british and american staff but it is a British curriculum. It opened a few months back and i am very pleased with it. It also means i don't have to drive across town as its near Qatar university to drop off my kid. i can recommend this place -small class and high quality.	0

Compass promised to be an "International School" but it plainly Enlgish. It is accredited by the New England association of Schools and colleges; so that somewhat reassures me. Now the big question- will it compete with ASD; take the kids who can't pass ASD's assesment or be even better than ASD??	0
Has anyone else heard this and have any info?? ?	I heard rumors of a new American based curriculum school coming to Doha. I also just recently took a survey asking me questions about what I would like to see in a new school.	I'm 99.9% sure that it is actually an American school that runs campuses overseas. ASD obviously has the best facilities out there; but for me that's not what's important. I would be surprised if any school can give ASD a run for their money on that front; but I'm sure it will do well barring any major problems with the school as a whole. The Compass curriculum is based on International Primary Curriculum. There are definitely elements of the British Curriculum in there; but it's not an "English" school. (It's working great for us; in fact - they've done a great job with our son; who has "differences".)	1

Which works best for you; a daytime or nightime workout/exercise. Any advice?	Being a sleepy head its hard for me to wake up earlier. But in the evening i go home past 9p due to work schedule.

Ya walad! :-) Welll; It's better if you learn the standard Arabic.But If you want the Egyptian Arabic it will be the best accent because everybody understand it ; thanks to tv :-) ( You want to use the spoken only?;because you wont understand the written or the tv news because they are mostly in standard) hummm;yes it IS different but I guarantee you that people from the Gulf will understand it.

Please would you tell me whether the language is very different to gulf arabic? I learnt How are you this morning and the phrase I learnt was not Kheyaf Haalic which I thought it would be so maybe I am wasting my time.	Hi everyone (particularly aisha and safwany). I am learning egyptian arabic from a tape (before my proper lessons start so I can learn fast).	Super7.. Egyptian arabic is a bit like say an irish accent :) Most people in england will understand it (thanks to terry wogan and the like) but its not how you should start unless ur thinking of moving to egypt. Plus; being english; people would most expect you to have a classical arabic (neutral) accent. An arab talking to you would be very amused if you suddenly came out with azzayak ya sa3adat al basha :) Plus; the egyptian dialect mispronounces some letters so thats not good for a beginner. whatever you decide. i admire that youre doing what thousands of expats never do after decades here. Good luck Respect GIASI	1

It`s great u want to learn Arabic super7....the guys had good points....most of the Arab world understands Egyptian Arabic because we have the oldest media in the Arab world .....but i have to ask GIASI....(as an Egyptian)...who the h--- speaks like that. What CHARACTERS say in movies or TV series does not represent how most Egyptians talk......it`s just the character talking....It is extremely common though for non Egyptians to stereo type us....lili.	1

I am learning egyptian arabic from a tape (before my proper lessons start so I can learn fast).	Super 7; Despite 800 years of paceful occupation; Spanish is very much a latin tongue so I find French or italian to be much more similar to Spanish. Arabic has very little in common with spanish. You see ;the Moorish occupation in Spain was really very paceful and the spaniards were not forced to adopt the language or religion. Of course given the cultural superiority of the arabs at the time; they introduced lots of new things in politics; art; agriculture etc. and the spanish borrowed the arabic terms (words). So many spanish words are actually arab such as Alcalde (politics) Algodon (textile; cotton) or Alfombra (carpet) The sounds of spanish might vaguely remind to arabic sounds. Other than that; they are two completely different languages.	0

Lilipink... i was being sarcastic... :) But you have to concede that it is a strong dialect which really shouldnt be taught to non-arab speakers. most egyptians ive met dont pronounce the GHAF sound and the DHAL sound is pronounced like a Z. In much the same way; qatari arabic shouldnt be taught; or UAE arabic or Tunisian arabic etc.... Respect GIASI	0

I do not know the law regarding this but it does not sound as if it is fair to me.	It might seem illegal but the passport doesn't serve its purpose even if it's in your hands. Should you need to exit or leave the country; your company still needs it in order to arrange for an exit permit. Also;it's better to let your company have it for safekeeping. There have been lots of stories or even appeals in the daily papers of people who have lost their passport while it was in their possession. In our company; passports are stored in a fire-proof safe. The staff have the option of either keeping the passports with them or letting the company keep it. Majority prefer to keep it at the company's safe; it also guarantees that the Residence Permits are renewed on time; as it is a common practice that it is renewed a week before its expiry.	1

You must be one of the rejected applicant or fired in this school to talk against them. This school is perfectly good and my children are studying there. all the information you invented are rubbish. The reason some staff are leaving because they chose to sign a 1 year contract only; as most of them are new in Middle East. I have spoken to some staff that are leaving and this is one of the reason. others just decided to go home.	1
Does anyone know how good dis school is ? ?	there was an article in da paper about a new school opening named ISL (International School Of London) in Duhail area.	Most of the teachers I know in that school are well qualified and they are native English speakers who really care for the children.

Depends what you consider "a bad sense". While a lot of religion's claim that lust is some sort of a sin; without it the human race would be in dire trouble as no one would procreate. People lust after people they perceive as fertile and viable for successful procreation; it's actually a biological form of flattery.	0

what do u think about this ideal?	hi qler; i am sure some of you already know ;that carrefour dont give free plastic bags anymore.	I actually think it is a pretty good thing. Re-usable bags have been available for sale since the store opened. The amount of bags this place generates is insane.

They charge the thinner plastic bag for 15 cents (whatever in local currency) and I know for the sturdier bag (the one that cost QR2) you can change in the customer service once it's broken or damage. I changed mine last week and they changed it without any question.	1

So let's talk about it here! :-) I'm surprised that prostitution is that open in what is considered a conservative country; I mean if it's so obvious that these women are prostituting them; then I'm sure authorities know about it...the question is...why aren't they doing anything about it ?	1

I did not see anything deserving of sensoring/editing unless we look at the original post; and I am sure that could have been dealt with seperately and so keeping the thread 'alive'.	OK; thats understandable; thank you. It also underlines mir83 and my point that we believed prostitution is less tolerable here in Qatar. However; the fact remains that prostitution is wide spread in certain places in Qatar and thrives; until something is said by somebody; and then the routine mass deportations take place. It goes quiet for a while; and then the 'night girls' start building up in numbers again to the level they are now. My last sentence; before the previous thread was deleted was something like this; 'mark my words; the ladies will vanish any day now. Over the few weeks after that; their numbers will slowly increase again; and the cycle repeats it's self'. Obviously somebody is behind this (a pimp); as a sponsor for these girls.	1

Cornellian; somebody answered this on the previous thread just before it was deleted. I cannot recall the poster; but it was suggested that some body in authority; possible with some 'wasta' to throw around; was probably behind it. My apologies if I have not recalled what was said precisely; but I would go along with that theory anyway. There are just far too many girls; far too often; in so many places for it to be anything else. Unless somebody knows differently ofcourse ................?	0

I would guess that the authorities are 'bending' to a certain extent under the threat of this 'person's' wasta. The final breaking point is probably reached when the religious fraternity start to object/speak out.	1

But if that "pimp" is powerful enough to keep the authorities quiet; then he must be powerful enough to keep the religious fraternity too. I think no matter what anyone says or does; prostitution will always exist everywhere; because there will always be women who need the money and men who are ready to pay.	1

Does anyone know anything about living in Mesaieed ? Transportation in Mesaieed? Activities to be done in Mesaieed? Is it a real city or just industrial zone? Does i have to buy a car?	I am going to work in Mesaieed...	mesaieed is more like an industrial zone. Qatar Government try to develop it and move more people to live in there. It started by moving bachelor people who work for QP living down there. as far as i know they have 1 groceries shop under Shop Rite; 1 thai noodle; some other small shops. And if you do going to work for QP ... the medical centre and dentist in mesaieed are superb. Much better than Doha. i would say you will still need to get your own car to be mobile.	1

For family there're multistory flats building or independent houses (2 bed room or 3 or 4). The residential areas are "very quiet" and relatively much safer; compared to big cities like Cairo (I think the population is less than 30;000; at least up to now). If you're living there as bachelor; then you might be given a bachelor accommodation; one big room with a bathroom in a multistory building. There's a nice park and playing ground for kids there. Health center facility is good (the doctors; well... that depends). Public transport is not good; but for some it's sufficient. You might need to have a car as soon as you can. Public buses depart every hour or half an hour to Doha (usually quiet congested; but the bus trip from Doha to Mesaieed could be much worse especially at weekends). No taxi. Some drivers might be willing to take you to Doha for small amount of money. There's only.....	1

I am going to work in Mesaieed...	Thank you very much ... but i think that the company mentioned something about carvans?!! not a multi-story building. Did u happen to see carvans used as residential units? Carvans mainly means : a ready unit used for residential purposes or office. But I can't imagine how to live in carvans especially that it will take big land space to accomodate big numbers. I am single so i will be taking one single room. Please advise.	0

Anything esle?	Hi; Getting ready for the move over and I was wondering if anyone has any tips on things you really can not get in Doha that 'at home' is just readily available. Someone mentioned cough syrup and tampons.	The tampon shortage is long gone lol. I would advise bringing medicines thought; even though they are available here under different names I feel more comfy with my trusted brands (placebo effect I guess). If you use any specific hair care products I bring mine from home as many salon and drug store brands are not available here (Paul Mitchell; Goldwell; Joico; Aussi). Many UK food items are here in Shoprite and Mega Mart; and if they dont have it you can ask them and they will sometimes bring it in.

You can find Colemans mustard at MegaMart. You cannot get Red Wine vinegar or anything with the word "wine" in it! I do not "grocery shop" i forage; as you cannot find everything you need in one place. But you can find pretty much all you need; it will cost you though! I just moved her from London; and before that Japan; and i though it was expensive there! It was NOTHING compared to here...bring lots of cash if you want to eat like you do at home!There is a Marks and Spencer in Landmark mall that has nice food once in a while; bisquits and crisps and the like.

First get the Application Form for Profession Change; get your sponser sign & seal on that paper then goto Labour Dept(near to American Hosp) along with; 1) Sponser ID copy 2) Munciplaity Bill 3) Edu.

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL?

I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

Food outside is cheap too - just incase you suck at cooking. Everyone has a different standard of living - so it is difficult to respond to such queries. Now that you're considering the offer and you have accepted the fact that you'll be away from your family (not sure that is worth QAR 8k); i wish you all the best.	1

Are there  more  bars in Doha which allow only Couples and ladies?	Last wednesday I was walking along Al-Saad street; entered Cloud Nyn at Mewrab Hotel for the first time; but they didnot allow this single gentle man in. ONLY COUPLES ENTRY.	Yep. HEAPS of places. You can go to Oasis though; they always let single men in. Which is why there are absolutely no women in there; but its a fun night anyway. Its a rule they make to try to achieve some balance in the nightclubs. Even in Australia a group of men can't get into some nightclubs. Its a shame for you I guess.	1

Can you tell me the best places to go for a drink; where I might even stand a chance of seeing a woman. I've been in the Ramada - 99% bloke. I've been to the Qube (once) - 95% bloke. I've been in the Sheraton - 80% bloke. I went to Garveys (briefly) - thought it was a dive. Now I've only been here 3 weeks now. You say the oasis is good fun but it doesn't sound like much fun! ha ha Let me know if there is a secret place all the women hang out in.

Well I personally don't frequent any of those places.

If you want great music; lots of dancing;lots of food; and many many many single beautiful women then i recommend going to any hotels "wedding halls" on weekends to a traditional qatari wedding! Party usually goes on from 8pm till after midnight! I usually dont make it past 8:05pm given all the high heel shoes that get thrown at me and the drummer girls using my head to play the national anthem! But totally worth it!

Maybe I'll go upto the Ritz-Carlton; I was going to go last thursday evening but our plans got changed. I think I'll be checking it out. Is there a dress code? as although I can dress up casual smart; after going to work 6 days a week in shoes I like to enjoy taking them off! The cost to get in doesn't bother me and serves as a quality control it seems! I've been to the places I mentioned but I don't wish to anymore as they are a bit depressing. The Sheraton was ok the other night though; I saw an absolutely gorgeous girl in there; I was going to chat to her but she disappeared. Then today when I went for finger printing I saw her again as she left! I need to meet this girl; she is around my age too!

Well; the Admiral's is a tad bit small for a club. Get's really hectic and busy as in waayyyyyyyyyyy... I like the music in Pearl but; that was ages ago. I'm not sure if they still have the same djs. They should really start thinking of opening a wide array of clubs.. after all people really need cool places to go to.	0

Anyone else with mysteriously slowing DSL? When can we expect the Emiri decree for outside telecomm competition to come into effect; and rid the world of the scourge that is Qtel?	Slow at work; slow at home; started a couple weeks ago and getting progressively worse. I think Qtel is not upgrading their bandwidth fast enough to accommodate new DSL subscribers.	I agree.....we've been experiencing problems for about a week now and it seems to be getting progressively worse!Glad we're not the only ones with this problem...it makes trawling through worthless threads so much of a bore!!!

My DSL sucks too; and I was hoping that it wasn't just me. We are supposed to have the 1Mb connection in our place and it really doesn't seem like it. If i'm downloading anything at all; even if i'm only downloading at 20-30kb total; the connection to other computers in the house slows to a crawl. Unfortunately though; I firmly believe that there will never be a better alternative; at least not within the next 3-5 years. Qtel has all the resources in the world to build an infrastructure that's worth a damn; but they just won't. I'm glad all of our money is going to such good use.	1

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	1

Anybody has any idea about QF Housing Facilities?	Hi All I am joining QF in IT Div and as per offer; they will provide me 1 BHK - Fully Furnished accomodation.	Their Housing/other facilities are very good...but if the job is in IT; you have to be cautious before taking the offer. They recently (8 months back)outsourced their IT to EDS; so there are very less 'direct hires' to QF in IT. Even if you get hired; there is no gaurantee that you will have a job as they are very keen on Outsourcing and other important factor is the Qatarisation. Please check with the HR/Hiring Managers on these anc make sure you have a clear understanding of the road ahead before jumping in.	1
My question is do I need to get a visa if I want to go to Dubai if I have a Residence Permit of Qatar?	I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Although you can go to dubai and get visa on arrival if you are going by air but road travel is different. You have to pass Saudi border and you need saudi visa. In order to get saudi visa you have to get UAE visa first. Saudi gives visa only after you already have UAE visa on your passport. Hope this clarifies.	1

I have heard that it&#39;s really fun to drive from Qatar to Dubai on the weekend (obviosly if you have a 4 X 4 Drive).	Drive through Saudi is NOT dangerous. The road is absolutely normal; just keep away from trucks. The only problem is total lack of gas stations. However as it has been told here - it is not fun; and the only reason to do so is probably shopping in IKEA.	0

Why out of ALL nationalities the exception would be made only for UK? Citizens of 34 western countries can obtain a visa upon arrival; without prior application; but more or less the same rule applies to the entire world; not only in Qatar. ravi.shock; in order to obtain a visit visa (only Single entry; like everyone!); you have to have relatives here; who can sponsor you. They should know the requirements. Otherwise you can apply through the Hotel.	1

Then work visa.	1

What is acceptable?"	My wife and I are moving to Qatar in October from The USA (Texas) SHe is a bit concerned on what is proper dress for women. We have been told that anything is fine as long as her sholders are covered and her knees....She is very upset about having to ""cover up"" when its 115' degrees outside.	As a woman here in Qatar; I encountered the same problem when I moved here last year...I was told "long sleeves and long skirts". That is not entirely true; esp. in the summer when the heat is unbearable. Your wife can wear capris (knees do need to be covered) and short-sleeved tops as long as the neckline isn't too low. The benefit to long summer skirts is that they are actually cooler than pants. The general rule is that it shouldn't be too tight or two revealing. Also; keep in mind that they run the A/c on high everywhere; so your wife will probably want to keep a cardigan with her to wear around on top of short sleeves when she is in restaurants; malls; etc. You are arriving in October; so the weather will be fine; like spring weather in the States; very pleasant actually. Last winter it actually got quite cold here; so bring jackets and even a light-weight winter coat (or heavier if you intend to travel during winter). One other option: a number of western women do wear abayas aro.....	1

Let your wife relax. Think of it here as a conservative western country. The rule is to protect herself in a way that she does not dress anything that could be very very revealing and tempting some horny guys to bother her. very trasparent trousers or shirts or blouse is not rcommended. very very short skirt is not recommended.

I agree with Kelly here; for expats; its alright to wear sleeveless (well; considering the weather here now) and skirts……just don’t show more skin than usual And of course; If you don’t want to draw unnecessary looks from guys/lookers here; it is very intelligent to cover up…you will see what we mean when you set foot here… basically; everything is acceptable as long as you don't draw too much attention with what you wear..	0

Your wife can wear just about anything she wants as long as it is decent. The muslim ladies are totally covered up; cos according to Islam; the beauty of the woman is for her man only. I recommend that she wear "normal" clothes; this is totally acceptable for "western ladies". And at a club or at home anything. But when you go around to a supermarket or shopping mall I recommend she wears a little more covered up. This is not because of the Islamic point of view; but more for her own protection. Don't forget; there are a lot of men here that do not have their wives with them; and sometimes their eyes are falling out by looking around.... if you get what I mean Aisha-Taweela	1

If you come from the Salwa Road; pass The Centre; pass small roundabout. Instead going up to Jaidah Flyover; you go on the roundabout under the fly over. Turn left on the roundabout; drive all the way till to Manai Roundabout and make a u turn. After you make a U turn; just befor you reaching back the jaidah fly over; on the right there is small shopping complex that call Al Nasrallah centre or something like that (not too sure).

ANYONE KNOWS THIS COMPANIES? IS IT WORTH TO WORK IN THEIR COMPANY?	THEY ARE ENGAGE IN MARINE; REAL ESTATE; JEWELRY; CAR DEALERSHIP; EXCHANGE.	The HR employee of alfardan group (which is also a filipino) said to me that i can sponsor my wife after i get a residence permit there. probably the processing for RP according to her is about 2 months. She also help me to find a job for my wife there.Its my first time to go abroad and kinda scared and at teh same time excited. I also have several officemates before here in the phil who are now working there. I hope i can find a way to cut-off my expenses and i will really tighting up my budget to save. The offer for the position is quite good if we will based it in our country but based on what i found in this site its quite small. But nevertheless im still young and probably find better opportunity whenever it possible.	0
ANYONE KNOWS THIS COMPANIES? IS IT WORTH TO WORK IN THEIR COMPANY?	THEY ARE ENGAGE IN MARINE; REAL ESTATE; JEWELRY; CAR DEALERSHIP; EXCHANGE.	As far as the reputation of Al Fardan goes; it has a very good reputation in Qatar. They are rich as a company I guess; cause they seem to have their own Money exchange; High quality Jewelery shops; dealerships for Range Rover; BMW and Ferrari ... SO that does have some weight... I think they also have several businesses related to Finance and Oil...Hope this helps...	1

But that salary is certainly enough to live well on and to save quite a bit on (assuming you won't have a lot of other expenses). Benefits? No taxes! free furnished housing (probably doesn't include utilities -- check on this) free LOCAL medical (note that this is ONLY for local govt. clinics and Hamad Hospital; not the better private clinics in town where folks speak English; and it will NOT cover you when you return to your home country of origin in the summer -- be warned! It should also include free schooling for any kids you have (you don't say if you have any) -- and again; tuition here varies widely; so you need to know their cap on the dollar/riyal amount because I am SURE they would never pay to send your kids to the American School or something that cost more than; say; QR 25;000/year. Here's where some extra expenses might figure into the mix... So; not bad; but that salary is rather low for a PhD.	1
Will this be enough to live on?	I have been offered a teaching post in Doha. An apartment will be provided along with medical cover and a few other benefits such as travel to work each day. I have been offered 8500 QAR per month; which is around £1400 per month. This is a huge pay cut for me. After my UK expenses I'm left with just over £200 of 1500 QAR per month.	NO! Why; oh; why would you want to take a pay cut to come here??? This is not a kind place to those who are struggling financially. Let me just say that after skimping on food; you won't be able to go anywhere (no car) and you will have no money with which to do anything. Great life; huh? Mandi	1

Thanks; is 8500 QAR pm not a good salary then? I am meeting with the school principle and company directors next week; I'm going to try and increase my salary then. Ideally I'm looking for 1200 QAR as that more closely compares to my after tax salary here in the UK.	0

Hello dear; I am not sure what to tell you but each one of us is looking for something different and also in a different situation; the short answer is No unless you are here to join a family member or planing on staying here for few month till something else open up; Qatar is relatively expensive compared to many close by destinations but it could be decent and moderate for those who know how to save; wish u best of luck.	1

The rule of thumb for expat salaries is your salary in the US/UK plus 25% plus housing; transportation; medical; air tickets; etc. Please realize there isn't public transportation per se in Qatar. The Qatar government won't even let anyone bring a spouse unless their base salary is over 10;000. I'd say that's the line for "middle-class." But again; why would you even be tempted? They are offering you peanuts and that's a real sign of how they will treat you later. Mandi	1

Thank you guys for your help. I have the offer letter in front of me. The school is offering 8500 QAR a month; free accommodation; flights; medical care; plus a company bonus and gratuity after 1 years service. From what I've read from you; the school are taking the p***. I'm not sure what NOC is; can someone explain? I have a meeting on the 5th and would appreciate any advice on how to deal with salary negotiations. I am hoping to raise the salary to 13000 QAR. Which (after UK expenses leaves 8500 QAR of disposable income) Is that a reasonable salary to live on?	0

An NOC is a "no objection certificate." You cannot change jobs within Qatar without one. Schools don't generally give them. So if you want to leave your first employer in Qatar you must wait 2 years before working in Qatar again. Mandi	0

And all but your accommodation are required of employers in Qatar; so they aren't being that generous with the benefits. Let us know; but I'd be surprised if they came up to 13;000. Good luck.

does any one know which area( beach) they stay are staying?	I have seen lots of bird over doha during evening time. Guess they migrate here in winter.	The reason birds migrate is that they are avoiding the cold weather brewing in the place they are staying so they move to warmer countries. There is a possibility they are just "passing through" Doha when you noticed them. Scientifically; birds can travel thousands of miles so it's possible Doha is not their final stop. They might have headed towards Iran or beyond... Once they know that the weather in their place has warmed up; they go back.	1

does any one know which area( beach) they stay are staying?	I have seen lots of bird over doha during evening time. Guess they migrate here in winter.	JuliaRose; if u happen to look carefully; the birds are coming from Iran (the North Side) where the weather is more cold are going South to warmer / Tropical Climates. There are two types of Migration: long-distance migration; & short-distance migration. As per my knowledge; some short-distance migrating birds stay in warmer regions of Saudi Arabia along the red sea coast; whereas some more species travel to Egypt; Sudan and farther to Ethiopia. For long-distance migration; birds fly as far as South Africa too. More information can be found on WIKIPEDIA.	1
can anyone help? Should I go ahead or not ?	Hi I am in the process of signing a contract for a 2 Bdrm apartment at the Ezdan towers in westbay. The sales pitch was great and the show apartment I visited seeme OK. from the earlier postings I sensed there are problems there.

I went for the first time to Ezdan today and what a complete and utter piece of trash it is. The finishings in Tower 3 were atrocious. How could the builder let this happen? The building is relatively new and already broken tiles; filthy cielings and walls. The wall tiles are still filthy from the worthless masoners who installed them. Typical old Doha masonry. Paint around the light switches; paint on the trim; careless finishing throughout. PLASTIC MOLD DOORS?!?! How cheap can they be?? Seriously I would not pay 2000 QR a month for any these crap dwellings. Filthy windows; CHEAP CHEAPO CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP a thousand times over. All this and I can believe people actually live in this skunkhole. TRASH TOP TO BOTTOM. I have seen better in the older buildings near Musheirib	0

Furniture is not brand new; but at least comfortable and clean. Lighting is dull in the appartments... Kitchen is too tiny...Windows are small and dirty; but now they started to clean them. To cover all these negative points they provide the best gym and swimming pool in Doha; free of charge for tenants.

can anyone help? Should I go ahead or not ?	Hi I am in the process of signing a contract for a 2 Bdrm apartment at the Ezdan towers in westbay. The sales pitch was great and the show apartment I visited seeme OK. from the earlier postings I sensed there are problems there.	My friend lives there; it's very cheaply built and you have a hard time getting wireless in the apartments. He doesn't recommend it at all.	1

I've heard some crap about 1 and 2 but 4 is cool. The only pain I've had is that they insist on doing one of the 2 cleanings per week on a friday morning. I mean.. really.... most people are trying to sleep.... I would think it would make sense to do it during the week. I have a 1 bedroom (livingroom; kitchen; bedroom and 2 bath) on a 2 month contract. Honestly; I think its overpriced (and Im only on the 6th floor). But other than that... its pretty decent.	0
Any advice out there?	Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	1

I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	1

Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	1

Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Western opinion of Asian women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Here I actually mean women from China; Phillipines and Thailand..Easy prey for western men..In other countries South Asia and Middle east women are not availabl.....	0

Why donÂ´t you date our friend here; Gineeshlee; he wants more than sex...or so it seems. Anyways; on a serious note. IÂ´ve seen too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately...and you know what; Qataries are much better behaved than that. At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut. If you behave like a lady; chances are that you might find someone that treats you like a lady.	1

It is not necessary that all those scales are giving you the accurate weight. To be safe it will be better to keep it 58kg this time and you can see what will be the difference between your scale and the one at the Airport check in counter.	1

I bought the same weighing scale (square one) camry brand; and it's quite accurate. been using it for 3 years now. Just to make sure; allow 2kg less and be sure to adjust it to "0" before weighing. If it's packed; it will be better to bring extra Paper Bag or Plastic Bag; just in case.	1

What always works is a smile; try and make up a conversation with the check in clerk.

If you have a large bag of flour or rice (or both!) that haven't been opened; weigh them on the scale and check to the weight on the bag. I do that at my parents' home in North America - works quite well at calibrating the scale.	0

I bought one yesterday at Jarir Bookstore: US Robotics wireless ADSL router with USB printer server for QR.420. This would allow you to connect wirelessly two laptops from anywhere in your house to the internet at the same time; as well as print to a common printer located at the router's location. It also has 4 wired ports if you have computers with ethernet ports only (not wireless).	1

I'd need to get a converter which would cost about 60QR. One would it work there and two; you think it would just be simpler to buy another one there? Also if someone in our building has a wireless router; couldn't we just use there signal; maybe even pay them a bit for the use? Thanks	0

We use a wireless router as well (1 desktops; two laptops) and it is great; although the speed is a bit slower than wired (2nd desktop is wired and always has a faster connection than the others... We bought it locally; at the computer souq... sorry; can't remember the price; but will post again if it comes to me... ETA: you could technically share a wireless connection with your neighbour; but personally I wouldn't want to do that *long term* unless I had spoken to them and they were OK with it... are you going to know your neighbours that well that soon? hmmm... By my standards; internet connection here is not too expensive; and well worth it... I say go it yourself...

We had some local guy install a router in our building and we could not get some sites. We got in another guy and he found that the router was configured to the UAE internet and hence the set up could not be used here. We had to change the router. Better buy a router from the traders at Sofitel. You might pay extra; but atleast it will work. All the best. Angelo	0

Then when Q-tel gives me the modem I can plug the modem into our router through the big fat cable; then all will work. The router here has all the ports and DSL connections you mentioned earlier.

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....	1

The responsibility of pet ownership does not cease when it becomes "inconvenient". Why don't you take them with you? All you need is the correct paperwork; a cat carrier or two and the willingness to try. As for putting them on the street; better they should be euthanized rather than having them starve; get beat up by other cats; run over by a car; or tortured by some of the misguided children. It's good you're trying to find them a new home; and perhaps your circumstances are such that you really can't take them with you. But under no circumstances should you put them out to fend for themselves. Good luck.	0

If so; is it allowed in Qatar Airways as Check-in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home? Do we have to go through Red channel ?"	Has anybody taken 32” LCD TV to India.	Yes; you can take 32" through Qatar AirWays and you don't have to pay any customs for it. You might be stoped in Indian Airport; just show the recipt and you will be through.	1
If so; is it allowed in Qatar Airways as Check-in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home? Do we have to go through Red channel ?"	Has anybody taken 32” LCD TV to India.	LCD is cheaper in India than it is here. Also transporting the LCD is difficult as the screen is more tender than glass.... Taking the LCD there makes no sense. But if you what to take it there you will have to do it by ship as airways will charge you more....do it by courier..there are many in doha. But honestly buying electronics is cheaper back home.	1
If so; is it allowed in Qatar Airways as Check-in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home? Do we have to go through Red channel ?"	Has anybody taken 32” LCD TV to India.	A 32" LCD TV will weigh almost 25kg and will be bulky as well to handle to take as checked in luggage. You will get LCD TVs of all major brands with warranty/guarantee at similar or even cheaper prices in India. The Retialer will bring and install it in your house without any extra expnese. You will also get all services from there which you will not get if you are taking from abroad. It is not advisable now a days to carry such items from abroad with you.	1
If so; is it allowed in Qatar Airways as Check-in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home? Do we have to go through Red channel ?"	Has anybody taken 32” LCD TV to India.	It is absolutely right; LCD TV in all brands available in India and it is cheaper than Qatar; you dont need to carry heavy item with you and some time you may pay excess baggage and bribe or duty in Indian Airport? compare to all; buying LCD TV from India is practical. I did last year the same. I paid equallent to QR. 2200/- only no head ache. Now more cheaper.	1
If so; is it allowed in Qatar Airways as Check-in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home? Do we have to go through Red channel ?"	Has anybody taken 32” LCD TV to India.	It is not true that in India LCD tvs are cheaper than Qatar. 32" LCD tv cost 40000-45000 in India (Good brands). You can take LCD tvs without any problems. Qatar Airways will handle it with care; if you request them while check in. There will be some customs dutys as usual at destination port. But you can skip. As an Indian no need to explain you how! Go ahead. Enjoy your vacation.	1
If so; is it allowed in Qatar Airways as Check-in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home? Do we have to go through Red channel ?"	Has anybody taken 32” LCD TV to India.	Superman; the price of Lcd TV depends on the models and resolutions you are choosing. If you want an HDTV you should pay quite a lot. You will not get a 32" HDTV of Samsung for Qr. 2000/- in Qatar. You will get proabably a series 4 of Samsung for that price which will approximatley cost IRS. 30000/- and if you pay 32000 or 34000 Rupees you will get the same model in India installed in your house. If you are paying extra baggage it will cost you appoximately QR. 60/- per kilo and if you are sending it by air cargo it will cost another 1500 Riyals for freight and packing.	1
If so; is it allowed in Qatar Airways as Check-in baggage and how much duty paid in customs back home? Do we have to go through Red channel ?"	Has anybody taken 32” LCD TV to India.	Hello there I took a 32" LCD TV (Sony)to India Last month. There is no problem in the airlines to take tv as baggage. You should tell them that you have TV as baggage while taking the boarding pass. In Kochi Airport the customs asked me to show the Original bill. Actually we can take electronic goods of Rs. 25000/- with out paying duty. I spent 2000 riyals for the TV and had to pay only Rs.367/- as duty to the customs. They calculated as the tv costs 26000/- and charged duty for the excess 1000/-. The same model TV costs around 37000/- in India. My suggestion is buy the TV here but make sure the same model is available in India. [Coz if the model is not available in India it would be hard to get serviced]. Hope this'll help you :) cheers	1

Dont panic at all on seeing above replies. Getting a 32" LCD to India is nice Idea; as recently I have taken one. But thing is you have to look following points before you o it. a) Buy a low KG LCD TV - (32" LG/Sony LCD TV will not be more than 14 KG's)- I took LG which was just 11 KG's. b) It is very safe to put it in Check in Luggage; it will not break as they put "Fragile - Handle with care" sticker on it and handling it also with utmost care. c) Indian custom catches you immediately when they see a LCD TV. but truth is you have to pay duty for the total item you carry more than worth 25;000 QR. d) If your 32" LCD is going to cost you below 2;000 QAR then you ill not pay any duty other wise you have to pay duty for it. I took LG LCD which was 1800 QAR; just 11 KG's but its Indian cost was 35;000 INR so i literally saved around 15;000 INR Be calculative in what you do and have a happy journey!	1

Hi dude regarding handling customs; rates you got a good picture from QL only thing i can suggest you is qatar airways have new rule restrictions in baggage; last month i travel from doha to cochin; you are not supposed to have more than 2nos of bag as your lugguage; total of 4 i.e. *2 lugguage + 1 handbag + laptop allowed; 40+7(hand carry)+laptop say total of 50 depends on season they give lil flexibility; hope no one is aware of it; anyhow its chaged or not am not sure;check it before you fly instead of dying at the airport re-arraging; thanks Nice trip	0

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'. I am an ENGINEER without a MASTERS degree; but my title is ELECTRICIAN. What's the BIG DEAL? It's not because things are difficult that we don't dare; it's because we don't dare that makes things difficult!	0

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

In that case the sponsor might blacklist you from getting a work visa in Qatar or anywhere else in the GCC. Additionally if there are issues with the bank; they may send a collection agency after you even in your home country to recover any money that you owe. 2 - There could be problems; it depends on point 1. 3 - The bank account will technically remain active. It doesn't close down at the expiration of your RP; otherwise all Qatar residents would need to go to the bank every time they renew their RP. If you have a monthly account fee over time this will bring the account into negative balance; creating a potential problem for you and your sponsor. Leave peacefully and do the right thing by your sponsor. If you leave by going on holiday and not coming back you are only going to make a problem for yourself later.	1

any advice?	I had rented a car from a local company; they needed the car back for 1 day to get it registered. They gave me a loaner car to use and the loaner car broke down while I was driving it. The car rental company is saying its my fault and that I have to pay for a new engine on the loaner car. I refused to pay and the car rental place said it will send it to the police and the courts. I am an American female.	Tell them to go ahead. Unless you were negligent; it's their problem. You didn't take a sledgehammer to it; did you? You didn't put something other than motor oil in; did you? Seems to me you'd REALLY have to try hard to blow an engine in one day.	1

I am an American female.	Hello; I would definately discuss with a lawyer. Did you sign a contract? If so there should be a limitation on the amount you have to pay eg 1500 QAR in the event of a accident etc. However; I wouldn't pay anything yet. If you were driving the car normailly and were not in an accident that was your fault; then the problem is theres. They provided a car that wasn't safe or suitable for normal driving. Depending on what your lawyer says you could tell them you are going to call the police against them and see what they say. They might back down (again speak to someone who knows if there are any ramifications for this!) It may also be advantagous to have someone call on your behalf. There are bound to be some lawyers in here who can give you some quick advice. All the best; if you need anything please PM me. Cheers	1

Should Muslims wear football jerseys which display images of crosses; liquor brands and devils? If they did; would it be as if Muslims are worshipping and exalting the symbols of other religions? What do you think?	Among the football teams whose crests carry images of the cross are Brazil; Portugal; Serbia; Barcelona and Norway; while Manchester United carries the Red Devil slogan on its team crest.	Let the muslim player playing the sport decide that for himself; he's got a mind of his own and you nor me are in a position to dictate what he should or should not wear. So stfu and go to your corner. Like the wiseman Rizks said; this thread will take an ugly turn!	1

I have a request to the mods to delete such threads and I will flag it as offensive. I do have another request to all QLers not to post offensive subjects in this forum. I know that a real Muslim will not post anything offensive to another community and I am expecting the same from all the other communities in QL and if things are going in this way then I will say good bye to QL even if is of not something important for you all. Please abide the guidelines of the forum. If anyone is interested for a debate on something related to a community they should approach the community leaders for a debate.	0

Without bothering the find the details. Did I issue the instruction? No; I just asked the question to find out the opinion of Muslims in the Gulf. Did I insult the religion? Not at all. But yet you choose to come to the defence of the religion (I hope) by labelling me an idiot. How am I an idiot? By seeking to clarify confusion and misunderstanding? From the views expressed above; it is obivious that not all Muslims share the opinion. So obiviously this is a misinterpretation of the religion. And that helps separate religion from the politics and propaganda that cloud it. Perhaps you should jump into the gulf. Seeing as you're already jumping to conclusions.	0

Please seek assistance of a travel agent at the hotel where you're staying. Discuss your itinerary. This is a must. You have only 4 short days; you can't possibly see a lot with that but with assistance you may at least see some. NEVER VENTURE ALONE TO OUT OF THE WAY PLACES!	1

Brit I have given up on curry as an idea in Qatar. I have decided that it would be better to look for other food experiences for my son while he is here. As the curry back home is better.

And yup I went against the advice. But the theme of the thread still seems to be; that the curry is just as good; if not better in the UK. And back home I live in a sleepy little city that has no Thai; no Lebanese; and no Turkish restaurants. So it's best to give him food experiences he can't get back there.	0

Aryaas is mid level.....everyday food at low cost. And it's mainly veg. But if you are in for a good diniing out experience I wouldn't chose it. There's Maaza; they do a mean "Kadai chicken". There's Asiana; not typical Indian food; but it's OK. Then there is Shalimar for the banana leaf Sadya. Their butter chicken is also good.	1

With e-Passport; the photo is digitally taken at the embassy itself and they added 40 QAR so now; it's 240 QAR. But before going to the embassy; better to have your old passport photocopied as photocopying there is a bit more expensive than outside. Lol!	0
I was wondering if i buy stuff from either Ebay; Amazon; NewEgg or TigerDirect; do i 100% get the item or do some people scam me? And how much time does it take to ship it to Doha; and how much are the shipping charges? Say i buy something used from Ebay; how can i ask it to ship it here as it doesn't give an option for Qatar.	Hey Qlers.	hey; i know that www.qbay.com (the ebay site for qatar) will be available but I don't know when. Someone was telling me that it will be very safe because you need to enter your qatar mobile number into the site and then varify your identity with an sms code.

Hey Qlers.	I buy from all three places plus mwave.com; zipzoomfly.com and amazon.com. I use bongo us mail forwarding as they consolidate shipments. With aramex; each parcel is shipped separately and there is a minimum charge. So if you buy a memory card that weighs next to nothing you pay $30 or so. I believe aramex then charges about $8 US per pound for heavier parcels. Bongo consolidates - gathers all your parcels and weighs them as if they were one. They ship all your parcels as one shipment. You will save hundreds of dollars over a year of shipments. I have gotten shipments that I have paid only $6 a pound for and saved on consolidation. Check them out they are fantastic. http://www.bongous.com/parcel_forwarding.php Aramex should wake up and provide consolidation services. DHL is also laughable as they do not consolidate. Fedex is never going to do that as they make too much on commercial shipments.	1

Wait... to top it off you lot live cheaper here than we westerners do... You have "Asian only" places to rent... To get a fair deal I have to send my Indian and Pakistani friends to the souq so I can get the same "Asian discount" that you do... Your cost of living is cheaper than mine is here in Qatar and back home. You have it better than me and my western counterparts on many fronts.

This does not justify the higher pay to Westerners. The payment should me made on the work you do. If an Asian worker is doing the same job; in same grade with similar qualification; there is no reason that he should be paid less. Lifestyle Asians have is their choice. Mainly it is because they earn less; not because they like it. An Asian stays in an apartment not because he 'hates' living in a villa in compound. He does so because most of the time he can't afford it. Let's start paying Indians and Pakistanis in Indian and Pak Rupees because cost of living is less in India and Pakistan. One who is being paid QAR20;000 should be paid PKR20;000 because he can live in Pakistan in this pay. He lives in Pakistan; his kids study there; he buys daily grocery from Pakistan and comes to work from there to Doha every morning.	1

Most people come here to work a while; save money and go back. Unfavourable exchange rates and higher cost of living back home means that westerners have to be paid more to make it an attractive proposition for them to come here. It is only reasonable. If they were giving out Qatari citizenship and more and more people could settle here then maybe I will think a bit differently. /\____/\___/\_______/\______________/\__ ____________________________________ You Lost Me!!	1

I'd like to agree but when I went with a Western friend to some of the Asian schools here in Doha because the tuition is cheaper they refused his children based upon Nationality and nothing else.

First get the Application Form for Profession Change; get your sponser sign & seal on that paper then goto Labour Dept(near to American Hosp) along with; 1) Sponser ID copy 2) Munciplaity Bill 3) Edu.

Do you go around with; showing everyone your LABOR CONTRACT where it states that you are MANAGER? Does anybody around you care whether you are Manager or not on your VISA? I can't even seem to find the benefit of changing the title; not unless you want to brag around everyone saying 'I've got a Manager's title on my VISA'.

The title of my visa was labor.As uyou said it doesn't make any difference until I try to bring my family here; Because we are not able to bring our family if our visa in such title even we are working as a manager ; I canceled my RP while I go on vacation and cameback in new visa as engineer. I heard that even we we can visit UAE for 7 days if we had a engineer or doctor visa (not sure).	0

How long is the process of exit permit. Where should I seek help for this matters?	Its been 3 weeks I have been waiting for the release of my exit but our mandoub said they have problem in our company license. They need to process first the license of the company which I am under of that company. Then after processing of license that would be the time that he can process my exit. Is this the right procedure or is there any other way to process my exit.	Not necessary to wait such long time for exit permit. If the company licence is expired; your mandoop can make the exit permit by paying Qr.100/- at the immigration.	1

I enjoy my Rainbow and Lipton when I'm in the mood. As for SAVING; since that is your question. I think it is pretty simple. Start from the first day. When you get your salary; ex. Qr10;000; set aside Qr2;000 in a saving account that you would open. Make sure you make it a standing monthly order; so your brain will function to accept that your salary is only Qr8;000 and you would have to manage with that. Maybe you would want to start small; but 20% of your monthly pay is a great start. Then you can increase it when you manage to settle into the saving/budgeting lifestyle. Good luck!	1

Some agents are worse than the greedy landlords; it is better not to tell them where their hubbys work so they can get a response; or you can tell them to contact me if you want :) By the way; I may have something very nice in this area but it is not cheap; what is your budget ?

Produce Atested Marriage certificate to wife sponser and ask fr a release;here as Darude said it is HR screws up;if she has acess to sponser ask her to meet the sponser and explain;definitely they will oblige and no chance of messing up;do not inform HR or Mandoop if she is aproching sponser directly as 100% they will confuse and spoil entire Broth.

Well; what does that mean? Is that so? or expat is just everyone who is not local?	Hi All; I noticed that people selling their cars say that they are "expat" or "expat car". Do "expat cars" bring more value than local folks' cars. I know expat take care of their cars and spend money on it. But; really .. who is an expat. To me .. when I read the advert; I expect an native english speaker or europeans.	In its broadest sense; an expatriate is any person living in a different country from where he or she is a citizen. In common usage; the term is often used in the context of professionals sent abroad by their companies; as opposed to locally hired staff (who can also be foreigners). The differentiation found in common usage usually comes down to socio-economic factors; so skilled professionals working in another country are described as expatriates; whereas a manual labourer who has moved to another country to earn more money might be labelled an 'immigrant'.

If you are an Arab with a westerner nationality; you are still called an arab with a westerner nationality. That is true for Indians; Pakis;...etc. I think historically; the British expats who were here in the early days (70s; 80s) were a true representation of expats. However; this has changed a lot through our the years. I think the term "expats" now apply to a wider group of people. Anyway; all expats are welcome as they as they understand the culture. One sad thing though; is the separation between expats and locals. There is a boundary and low engagement. That is why those terms will still have a meaning. I am really looking for that day; when this term "the way it means today" disappears!	1

The sponsor will not cancel the RP until receiving a bank letter stating that there are no outstanding liabilities. So if you owe money on a loan you can't leave until its is settled. Best to borrow money from friends/family to pay it off; or you might get arrested for being a loan defaulter. There is nothing you can do to avoid paying back the money.	1

suppose if find good prospects; can i send resignation by email	I am employed in a semi govt organization here in Qatar . i have just got permanent immigration approval for Canada from India. Can someone advice; if i should resign and then go or i take one or two months leave to go to Canada and seek job opportunities.	You could as a courtesy email them. There is nothing they could do about it; is there? I can't see them sending people to Canada to drag you back. Take the 2 months leave. "Deaths in the Bible.

A agree; take the 2 month vacation and try to find something higher paying. If you find something; just email them saying you are sorry but due to personal reasons you can not return. They probably won't be happy about it; but at that time you would have another job so it won't be like they can keep you from finding something. ****************************************** What difference does it make to the dead whether the mad destruction is wrought under the name of totalitarianism or democracy? -Gandhi ******************************************	1

I don’t think you will immediately adjust to the country. It takes years when things go right; but at the moment life isn't easy there (high unemployment and huge tax loads). If you have a family to take care of; perhaps it would be wiser not to take risks when you have little chances to succeed. Take leave (don't disclose the reason to your employer) and go there to assess personally the situation. Good luck!	1

I have seen numerous cases of people getting Canadian visas and having no intention to work there. They base their families there and continue working in the Gulf with higher packages (because of the new passport). So; it all comes down to what your REAL intentions are. I would go with Baldricl's suggestion that you do the honourable thing and resign. perhaps you could get a commitment from your employer that he would consider taking you back in six months time if needed. Good luck anyway :)	1
Is there any crash course for basic phography that perhaps we can apply in our near future?	photography is our recreation with my hubby; and we realize it is nice management for stress.	You can try a distance learning course with the newyork institue of photography. I have signed up for this course about a year ago...the website is www.nyip.com. Costs 1000$. They will send you the books;DVD's and CD's and many many other things you will need. you take their tests at the end of the each module and send a photo project and you are assigned your own tutor to criticize your work and you move on according to your own pace.	1

I know its a new school; but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow American or British curriculum?	We are relocating from South Africa in July and I have literally applied to all the British and American schools for my 4 years son and been refused by each of them. We have however been lucky to get a spot at ACS Doha.	As you say; it's a new school; so it's difficult to confirm anything! I believe the buildings are not yet 100% complete ... but it's nothing for you to worry about; since the school year will only start in September.

Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types. Remember; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers. There are still many good schools where your child will much happier. Take Sherborne which is a very good school in the UK I hear but here in Qatar it is suffering from the same problem I mentined above!	1

Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly.	Well; it is 3% in the first year anyway. I think the insurance companies might have agreements with the insurance carriers and direct buyers to a particular insurance agency. Invariably you will return to the insurance company you used when you bought the car. When the annual renewal comes up though you may find that it is way higher than 3%! Or else we weren't skilled/persistent enough to negotiate it down to 3% :) Here is a short blog about our experience with car insurance renewal. http://tinyurl.com/elmrk from my blog about life in Qatar: http://www.xanga.com/BBetz	1

Car insurance not really that bad. In the UK you insure the driver ... in here you insure the car. So anyone can drive the car and still insured. If you know what i mean. We pay around 2000 QR for our cars. Again our car are not a posh car. :-)	1

I think you will find that the car is covered for accidents but not people in the car. You may need to take out seperate insurance for the passengers. Fully comprehensive in Qatar is not the same as fully comprehensive in the UK	1

Having read a lot about about the 'hectic' driving in Doha I was wondering whether car insurance is quite costly.	Car Insurance is quite different from Western practices. As noted above; you insure the car; not the driver; which is one of the reasons kids here can afford to drive massive landcruisers; despite the slaughter of pedestrians. (Blood money for non-Moslems is pretty minimal; anyway.) For cars over a certain age; (2 years? Dunno) 3rd party is the only option. however; and again as noted above; cover for passengers is not automatic so check these things carefully with your Insurance Broker. Even the possibility of having residual alocohol in your bloodstream when some idiot slams into you some morning has to be specifically covered; so it's not a bad idea to go to a reputable international Insurance company if you think you might occasionally have non-family passengers or drink beer of an evening.	1

When you take out full insurance; you will normally be offered the choice of insuring the driver and ex-number (you chose) of passengers. Additionally; as stated; you can insure against being over the limit (excess alcohol); although I do not know what would happen if a driver was drunk and had an accident.	1

Does anyone know where i can do some water sports activities at a reasonable price and what is a reasonable price?	I'm from South Africa and on holiday in Doha till the 19th Oct. I would like to do some water sports(jet skiing; etc)this week ; but the tourist companies offering these facilities ask a arm and a leg.	If you hire from the people near the Intercon beach please; please stay away from the sailboats. Some idiots were weaving in and out of the boats last week and actually knocked some kids out of their boat. I wouldn't be surprised if those poor kids never want to set foot in a sailboat ever again.	0
should i exit and entry to get the RP or can we change the visa without exit?	Please advice me how to change the business visa to resident permit. i have the employment offer and visa has been issued by the employer.	Hhhhmmm..

should i exit and entry to get the RP or can we change the visa without exit?	Please advice me how to change the business visa to resident permit. i have the employment offer and visa has been issued by the employer.	You don't need to exit. Just get an NOC from the sponsor that got you the business visa along with the new one to Immigration Dept at Gharaffa. I believe you need to fill a form (not sure now). Your new employer will pay to transfer sponsorship. Just ask your mandoob or your new employer for details. But I'm sure you do not need to exit the country before being issued an RP for sure.	1

Rheisalyn; One option is to exit Qatar the process all depends on the company's PRO and availability of approved visa.. Max. number of days not more than three. You also have an option of not exiting the country; business visa can be transferred while you are still in the country..	0

It is a Great Dane.. am I even allowed to bring him?	Hi everyone. I have been in Doha for 5 months; but had to go home. Now I am wanting to come back; but I would like to bring my dog with me.	How would you drive here? You; as a female; are not allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia. I don't know where you're coming from but if; for example; you're coming from UAE - you would need the proper documents issued by the UAE authorities/vets; probably documents allowing you to import/transit an animal via Saudi (if a man is doing the driving and if you are married to him; his sister; or his daughter or his mother) and then more docs to allow the dog to enter Qatar. If you're coming from further afield and have more countries to pass through; it gets even more complicated on the document side. I suspect nearly all of these countries would require a vet inspection by their vet before allowing the dog entry/transit through their country	0
It is a Great Dane.. am I even allowed to bring him?	Hi everyone. I have been in Doha for 5 months; but had to go home. Now I am wanting to come back; but I would like to bring my dog with me.	And I will of course make sure that the dog is fully vaccinated and have all it's documents in order - and that goes for every country we will transit. Also; I would have my stepfather come and pick me up in Saudi; as women are not allowed to drive there. When I was last in Doha; I was told that bringing a Great Dane was illegal and impossible; but now I see that they are only restricted; so I guess I have all my questions answered. Luckily my family lives in a big house with a nice garden with the lagoona in the backyard; so apart from the heat; the dog wouldn't get it any better. :)	0

Great Danes are not banned in Qatar and big dogs have always been allowed into Qatar. Whoever you are getting your info from is feeding you false information. Please go to www.qatarpetrelocators.com for info and mail contact@qatarpetrelocators.com for assistance with brining your animal. Doha is not a bad place for pets. Its the same the world over. Just because Qatar is a small country; it seems like we are over run with animals. Just remember that when taking your pet from Qatar - Europe (if thats where you go to next) requires added documentation.	1
Can u advise me which make I must choose.? Dell; Sony; HP....?	I want to buy a laptop (Core 2 dou).	I have bought a DELL Studio XPS just before moving to Qatar ; but returned it right away. If you're a picky user; you will be dissapointed with the amount of heat it can generate. XPS is basically a gaming machine. Then I have bought a toshiba and very very unhappy with it; sometime it just stops working. From my previous experience; IBM T series laptops are the best one; then Dell Lattitude series.Never buy Dell inspiron series; my wife got one - very cheap made laptop. Finally if you have the budget go with the Macbook Pro - it generates less heat; battery life is also good and runs on BSD Unix on the background. You can also visit CNet or Amazon.com to see some of the reviews before even choosing one. Cheers	1

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	1

How much do you put up with as a customer when dealing with rude service people? When do you decide enough is enough and you complain to management?	I have a question for all of you.	If I am back home in the States...I will not tolerate it at all; and have been known to hang the phone up when a sales associate is having a personal conversation while I am waiting to be rung up...or reporting them directly to the store manager. Here; I am a bit more tolerant since they don't get paid very much..but again; it depends upon how they are acting. If they are purposely being rude; then I will ask them to call the manager over and deal with it in front of the salesclerk. That usually gets results very quickly. If the clerk is just not smiling and going through the motions..I have to wonder if they are having a really bad day or are exhausted; and let it slide. Grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked;the good fortune to run into the ones I do;and the eyesight to tell the difference.	0

How much do you put up with as a customer when dealing with rude service people? When do you decide enough is enough and you complain to management?	I have a question for all of you.	It depends. If it's a souq store; for example; I walk away and won't buy anything. If it's a store big enough I complain pretty quickly. I work hard and don't want to give my money to a place that's not interested. If management does something about it; I buy. If not; I walk away.	1
How much do you put up with as a customer when dealing with rude service people? When do you decide enough is enough and you complain to management?	I have a question for all of you.	Key phrases for complaint e-mails (taught by company to deal with underperforming suppliers/consultants) 1./ Always ask their name; sharpens the mind 2./ E-mail something like 'I'm saddened by your response to X' 3./ Next level is 'I'm saddened and disappointed by your response to X' 4./ Next up 'I'm saddened and disappointed; but not surprised by X' given what I've heard from colleagues'. C.c. in someone senior. Have had calls back from senior directors etc to the last one. Very entertaining. As far as shop assistants go - could not care less as long as I get what I want and quickly. Get irritated by poor restaurant service though. Always get the manager over and tell him why you're not leaving a tip...	1

How much do you put up with as a customer when dealing with rude service people? When do you decide enough is enough and you complain to management?	I have a question for all of you.	Just asking because a sales clerk gave me a hard time for asking him to complete an order of mine he didn't finish (yes I was polite) and he started an argument with me (this was last week). I complained.. Went back to the store this week and the sales clerk saw me and came over to argue with me about filing a complaint. I complained again and told them I don't like shopping in a store where employees can be hostile towards customers. Got a call and the manager said he fired him. I didn't want to get the guy fired but I do want to shop in peace without some yob coming up to me waving his hands and raising his voice to me. Was trying to get a general idea of what others think is too much. Or if its a matter of my tolerance level being too low. ______________________________________________ Brazilian Jujitsu in Qatar http://iloveqatar.net/bjj/	0

If the three holidays were before the starting of your leave then you are entitled to get the salary. If those three holidays were at the end of your holidays then you are not entitled. In the second case you should have joined at least the day before the Eid holidays. In your case you are not entitled as the Eid holidays were in the middle of your leave.	1

Anybody can please tell me; whether I can extend this futher more; maximum of how many months?	I'm currently in Doha on a 3 month Visit Visa.	you can extend a family visit visa for a maximum six months; but in any case that you have to extend it again after your 6 months limit; you can do that; too. i think upto 1 month; more. you just have to submit application form again to immigration with your flight booking details.	1

Tourist visit visa is is valid for 30 days and can be extended for another 30 days ; 60 days stay in total.	1
http://www.altmuslimah.com/a/b/rsa/4291/ This raises the larger question; do you think men in general (regardless of religion) prefer to marry someone who is younger and less educated? Are marriages more successful when the woman is less educated and younger than the man?	I came across this editorial on how Muslim men were supposedly intimidated by well-educated females in their thirties when it came to choosing a wife.

Get over it Britexpat; I don't have an alternative agenda. 1. I read this article. 2. It got me thinking about if what she wrote about a specific group (Muslims professionals in the US) is also true for other professionals people such as the likes that post on QL. 3. To give people the opportunity to draw their own conclusions; I provided both the article that inspired me and the larger question. You could have also pointed out that the article is about Americans; but that just wouldn't be snarky enough would it? :-) Tinkerbell--I wouldn't apply this to all men; but it shows how insecure SOME men can be. In cultures where this sort of thing is the norm; I think it highlights expectations of the subordinate status of women.	0

Do you have any ideas for good British schools in Doha so I can have both children together?	Dilemma!! We are coming to Doha end of December and still have not secured schools for both my Children (5 yrs and 7 yrs old).

If you get one into DESS take it..and they are very good about making sure the next one gets in. It is worth the wait to get them into a good school. Other schools are small and not as good.	1

Although it has mainly Qatari students; they do have a small mix of other nationalities too; AND they are following the UK National Curriculum; in English of course. I have friends who work there. It is definitely worth a look. One school to avoid though - GES (Gulf English School). Not a proper international school; just masquerading as one! Again; I have friends who work there. They say there are some amazing students; and some brilliant teachers. But the whole management structure makes life there quite difficult; and even the pupils pick up on how shambolic it can be. Hope this helps! Good luck! :)	1

I agree with the one comment that said if the sibling is in; it helps a lot. Only problem with Park House versus DESS is the travelling right across town. QIS is worth a look. The new principal there is a British woman and is highly respected in Doha.Great things are happening there- also it's much closer to DESS for travelling purposes.	1

DESS was good; as was Sherbourne; but we were HUGELY impressed by Compass International School. After a short tour from the registrar; we put down a deposit on the spot. Excellent varied curriculum; truly international pupils from many countries;lots of activities; good facilities and they are opening a brand new second school which means right now they have plenty of room. Could not recommend them highly enough.	1

Anyone have any idea why Qatar (or GCC for that matter) is not in Kindle (e-book reader from amazon for those who don't know) coverage? So what's the problem....?	I would think the demography of GCC will suit them well: compact area; high expatriate concentration; general lack of other entertainment (more time to read); high disposable income for reading expats and lack of proper bookshop.	My colleague has a kindle and it works perfectly fine.

I know its a new school; but has anyone heard anything about it and is there confirmation of whether they follow American or British curriculum?

Because it is so overpriced and because of its location it would attract mostly these types. Remember; your child will learn more from his peers than from his teachers. There are still many good schools where your child will much happier.

Many people do not know this procedure and stick with the job. The only thing is that they may charge ur flight & visa exp. from ur settlement. I slightly differ with Mr. HR Manager ! u can protect the employer's interest by penalizing the guy the money they spent for employing these people. many unlucky guys land here with bad employer without fulfillig promises and unsuitable working environment which may compell them to leave. so let them leave and search for something they they feel good.	1

Does anyone have experience with this?	I am setting up my home and am thinking of trying ebay or similar sites to try to save money. I might try to list some of my things to sell as well. I am wondering about shipping and fees and so on.	I use eBay in conjunction with Aramex for shipping. Some sellers on eBay will ship direct to Qatar as well. You will need to decide if it's wiser to spend the extra on shipping or perhaps buy locally. Aramex are a cost effective shipper from the states and the UK. When you join their Shop & Ship service they give you a postal address in the USA and UK. You have you items delivered to that address; and then they forward your goods to a depot here at reasonable rates. I don't think selling items on eBay is a viable option from Qatar. But somebody else may think otherwise.	1

I sold on ebay before I moved; but this looks like a good option. What do you think?	0

Firstly it's slow; secondly some of the images don't load and finally there is not enough traffic on it. But it looks like you are trying to address that ;-)	0

I am wondering about shipping and fees and so on.	Ebay is good.. two things. mind where you are buying the stuff from. if you are buying from china or Hongkong; then the seller would ship the item to Qatar with HK post which is cheap and most of the times he offers it free; but the wait time is minimum one month and 45 days is normal. you can opt to get it by HK registered post too with additional shipping cost ranging from $4 to $20; which is much faster and secure. if you are buying from other countries like US; the standard shipping is done with USPS which is no better than HK post; its take a month too; alternatively if you opt to get it shipped with UPS/DHL/FedEx from the buyer; then price for shipping ranges anywhere from $140. alternatively to buy from the US seller is Easyshop by DHL; or shop n ship by Aramex. check their website to know how they work.	1

I think I will try to sell something first; because the site looks so new - there aren't too many things to buy. I'll let you know how it goes.	0

I have a close friend and she's leaving w/ all the rest of the family to Abu dhabi still there are many who come here but those who stay for long i guess are very few. Even in our company the turn over of staff is high and it is really difficult because of lack of continuity of work. You are working w/ a thought in mind that the person who you are dealing with would be gone sooner or later. The soaring inflation rate is not the only problem here...the system is just crazy!

Basically we're tossing up between the new Jeep Cherokee and the new Volvo XC60.	For some reason; the people of Doha think that Nissan and Toyota make cars; and every other manufacturer makes wheelbarrows with engines... meaning that unless it's a jap car; no one else will buy it after you. For your question... the Volvo by a mile. It is comfortable; will last; the warranty is great; it's luxurious; drives well; and the interior is plush and refined. The other car is just an American thing that uses the same technology as the very first Jeeps manufactured 50 years ago... very little refinement or development. It is corse; uneconomical; and a barge to drive (literally; as it uses a truck chassis; as opposed to the Volvo that actually uses a car chassis). So; the question is; do you want to drive your car for at least 3 to 5 years and sell it for nothing; a car which you will enjoy driving and be kept quite safe in... or is it a financial investment; you want something back on it; and which you may kill you if you crash it (look at a picture of a landcruiser after a .....	0

Itll make the volvo look like it was made by kindergarten kids. Land cruisers are perfect for the country in general and especially for the weather thats coming up. They are built like a tank. Very comfortable and safe for both long distance and city driving; huge cargo space; service and parts are cheap and resale is amazing. Volvos are cute little cars; you can buy one for the wife to run around town in.	0

Like when I hear something in Chinese :) One of the Prophet's companions used to hear the Prophet and his companions say rhetoric supplication so he expressed his disappointment to the Prophet that he cannot say what they can saying that he only asked God for Paradise and sought refuge from Hellfire. So the Prophet told him: Around that we supplicate. Prayers or supplications shouldn't be complicated.	0

Why don't you just not fly whichever air carriers who you believe do not meet your minimum safety standard requirements... Of course that would mean that you need to personally check on each pilot and make sure he or she does not secretly place his faith on a God you don't believe in...

O Allah; You are our Companion on the road and the One in Whose care we leave our family .

I'm saying pilots should be doing checklists not prayers. People can pray all they want; and they can leave everything in life to God; just not when I'm on board the aircraft. I don't believe in god to get me down safely; I DO believe in the pilots to get me down safely. Veri: It's actually not rubbish. Following link is an example where pilots have relied on God to get them down; but he failed. Maybe if they had done their job proper; those people wouldn't be dead today.

This happened during the prohpet's time; after finishing a prayer; a man got outside the mosque and did not find his camel which he left. the man; surprised; said I depended on God!

I DON'T mind when people pray. I DO mind when they leave everybody's fate in the hands of God. If you know your English; you will understand that "I DO mind when they leave...." doesn't mean "I DO mind that they all leave..." In other words; I'm not saying everyone is leaving everything to God; but some do and it only takes one bad apple. That's all I said. QL: I can handle religion just fine. I just can't handle when religious people can't handle the truth. Veri: Nope; the one thing I can promise you I wouldn't do if I knew we were crashing; is scream "I believe; I believe...". I would be looking for the nearest exit and if time permitted; I would write a letter to my family. But that's just me... If everything seems under control; you're just not going fast enough...	0

Hey i would like to know where in qatar i get some good quality dog accesorries? dog collars; dog bed; bowls?	incl.	I have found it rather hit or miss to find good quality dog toys/treats/medicines/dog beds. I have found that I can order many of these on line and have them shipped here (hey; my dog is worth every Riyal). http://www.dog-beds-n-beyond.com/coolaroodogbed.html is a website with a description and picture if you're interested. Shop around; prices do vary. I have also bought frontline and preventic collars to help prevent tick infestations on line. hope this helps.	0
Hey i would like to know where in qatar i get some good quality dog accesorries? dog collars; dog bed; bowls?	incl.	As a continuation of my previous post; you can find somethings here; the prices can be more expensive (or less so when you take into consideration shipping etc.) However; the bed is something I've never seen here. I like it because it keeps the dog off the floor; easy on the joints - my dog is older; and cooler as the air circulates around it. It is also easy to clean/wash and dries quickly.	0

I have also heard this; but at the moment it just seems like a prediction arising from the failing western economies having some kind of negative effect in the more sunnier and financially secure parts of the world like Qatar!!

BUT I CANNOT SEE ANYTHING HAPPENING IN QATAR LIVING SITE.WHAT REALY HAPPENS?	I HEARD THAT RENT IN QATAR IS COMING DOWN.	Right now a lot of Qataris have taken loans with their old property on mortgage to invest in new Buildings. The Buildings which have been completed were expected to get higher rent than what is available today. Coincidently almost 90% of the construction in Qatar was aimed at 25% -30%% of the people ie Rich people. In almost All the companies only the Manager level people can afford such rents and most of such staff are only a handfull. Previously the Banks were easygoing on the payback of the loans. But due to economic slow and shortage of the available money they are trying to enforce payment. The panic has not really hit the Villa size buildings but believe me it will hit the Villa scene in about a year. The panic will be so great that people in the Construction Industry will not be given simple Vehicle Loans forget about personal loans. The Estate agents (middle men) are trying their best to hide their fears. Lets see how long they are going to put up their fake masks.	0

Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids. The sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee's bank account.	There was a meeting held at Philippine embassy last week and they tackled about this matter. One of the requirements in submitting agreements in embassy is Labor contract signed by the sponsor indicating the salary of $400. We are still waiting for the confirmation of the additional requirement. Once the labor contract will be attached to the housemaid's agreement; the indicated salary will be implemented.	1

Anyone with more information?	I have been told that the Qatari government is about to introduce a minimum wage of 1460 QR per month for house maids. The sponsor having to pay it directly into the employee's bank account.	When I bought over a maid for slightly less monthly sum I was informed by my colleagues that m paying her too much - they pay around USD 200 - 250. In the interest of all there should be a minimum wage however my maid sends home 95 % of her salary - I remit it myself to her mothers account. She eats th same food as us; has her independence and is happy - her brother out here keeps thanking my friend for the recommendation. The point is the salary I'm paying is less than the OP cap and she is more than happy. It is in multiples of what she was earning back home	0

If you are western I would say you wont save much out of 20k; you would want a decent apartment / villa; good social life; weekends away. If you are the sort of person who is just coming here to work work work; then you will be able to save more. It will be trial and error until you find the balance that suits you and the lifestyle you want to have.	1

I am married with no kids and considering a reasonable life style.	I see a lot of people have already written a reasonable answer; but keep in mind following: - about flat or car rental - depends who negotiates. If a European person or a westerner in general - forget it to find those rates. For them everything is double. - as many have mentioned - depends on lifestyle. For example one of the most difficult issues for women here - to find a normal hairdresser; beautician; etc. usually too expensive and very low quality / level of hygiene. If you go to a normal place - prices are ridiculous for what you get.	0

Although babies born to expatriate parents are not entitled to Qatari citizenship; the birth still needs to be registered in Qatar; and a Qatari birth certificate issued (as well as a birth certificate from the parents' home country). The process for obtaining a Qatari birth certificate was simplified in 2010. All births should be registered at the Women's Hospital (next to Hamad General Hospital on Al Rayyan Road); regardless of which hospital the baby was delivered in. The hospital where the delivery took place should issue two letters to the parents confirming the birth. These should then be taken to the Women's Hospital; along with the following documents: A copy of the child's vaccination card The passports of both parents Copies of the parents' Residence Permits The parents' marriage certificate There is some paperwork to fill out; and a fee per certificate is payable.

If harmfull whats the effect?	Drinking milk after eating prawns is harmfull or just a myth.	Ayurveda has guidelines about dietary habits...like: # In the evening avoid heavy foods such as meat; fish; yoghurt; cheese; buttermilk and fromage frais. # Avoid eating between meals. Instead drink hot water; or if necessary eat ripe sweet fruit. # Avoid reheated or stale food. # Most of one's food should be cooked; as the body can more easily absorb cooked food. Raw food should be eaten only as a side dish (e. g. salad). # Make use of culinary spices. They not only make the food tasty; but support the digestive processes as well. # Include all 6 tastes in each meal: sweet; sour; salty; pungent; bitter; and astringent. The tastes also have their own influence on the subtle inner balance of the physiology. # During meals you may sip liquids such as water; juice or lassi. Do not drink a lot and avoid ice-cold drinks - they dampen down the digestive processes. # Milk should not be drunk with the main meal. It can be taken alone or with a light meal of sweet tasting foods (e.g. toast; cer.....	1

If harmfull whats the effect?	Drinking milk after eating prawns is harmfull or just a myth.	Carbohydrate rich food is not combined with acidic food items. eg if you take bread and lemon juice together; it will cause the digestive system to erratically digest both the items. Don't eat grain; cereal or pulses item with acidic items like citrus fruits; grapes; pineapple etc. Protein rich food items go well with low-carb food items like rice and vegetable. Vegetables also go well with all types of starchy; carbohydrate rich food items. Fruits should ideally be taken as a separate meal; independent of other regular meals. Milk and meat is bad combination. Never take milk and meat in a single meal. Separate intake of milk and meat by at least four hours. Milk and meat is good for body in several ways. When taken together; it becomes toxic. Many modern food styles fly on the face of this Ayurvedic food combination rule. Milk is also to be taken warm. Cold milk can cause indigestion. Taking milk too hot also is not desirable. Ending the meals with sweet dessert is not allowed in Ayur.....	1

Proper or Actual use of those tools rests at the hands of the staff. 1. Implementation is such a different issue. that depends on the staffs' intellect; willingness to adapt new processes; as well as their genuine service; not to mention that they should have real educations; not fake ones.	1

JCI is directing all departments for the right procedures and policies.to be honest if JCI is not visiting; there are enough staff just neglecting their work. that can be seen just before jci visit; their running everywhere. don't know what to do.coz they were not working.if we do daily updates and follow procedures ccomplete our day-to-day work and responsibilities; we don't have to scared of jci.what i noticed so many departments;heads are panic and updating everything only just before jci visit. i am really happy to have jci visit every month.	1

Is there any ways to comeback and seek for a job again?	I just want to ask if there is new rules about the ban in Qatar;once you are cancelled.	6 months ban without NOC could be possible? Please read & comments. However; the law makes it illegal for sponsors and employers to retain employees’ passports and travel documents once their residence permits have been issued. According to Article 4; any expatriate once dismissed from his job or quit on his own will not be allowed to re-enter the country before the elapse of two years from the date of his departure. However; this condition can be waived by the Minister of Interior; or whoever represents him. Also the department (to be designated later) in charge of enforcing the law may exempt some cases from this period based on a written permission from the expatriates’ previous sponsor; according to Article 4. The new law gives the Minister or whoever represents him the power to transfer sponsorship temporarily if there is a legal dispute between the sponsor and the expatriate worker.

Where can I rent a bus? 	I'm organizing a one day trip in Qatar for friends. I need a bus to travel with them. Toyota Coaster is a nice-sized bus.	No forget Karwa... those people r dumb. Just go to any rent a car and rent it from them. U can get a bus for around 1200 or 1500 a day.  When  I was working at Al Sulaiman Rent a car in 2004; the prices were 800.

I've PM'ed Frog.  Is Rayyx the company that rents out the yellow buses?  How can I contact them?  Are they pretty clean and smell nice?  I'm taking around some people who would expect to be driving in pretty nice (like a Toyota Coaster). I've contacted a few bus rental places (Thrifty; al-Muftah) and their prices are around QR750.  Is it possible just to hire a private guy who drives a bus around?  Giving him a reasonable per hourly wage; QR400 should be enough.	0

Maybe an Old Navy is next?	For all of you shoppers out there. On July 31; a GAP store opened in Villagio. It is at the end of the canal near the ice skating rink. The best part is; the prices are comparable to the original stores in the States. I just wanted to let everyone know. Also; a Banana Republic is opening soon in Villagio.	I feel sad. :( A lot of shops are opened. Qatari people are starting to abandon their traditional clothes. :(	0

Don't worry; Qatari's do a good job of wearing fashionable clothes as well as traditional clothes :) I don't really like GAP; but I do like their stretch shirts (which I like to wear under a t-shirt). If their prices are the same as the US; then I'm happy! In the UK; their prices are crazy!!! __________________________ I Love Qatar - http://www.iloveqatar.net	0

And another point to note is that sizes which will actually fit Western people often don't fly off the racks as quickly in other countries. I loved going to Gap in Japan; as I could find clothes which actually fit me in the clearance section; without paying an arm and a leg. Normally I don't shop at Gap either; but it became a must-visit whenever I saw one. Can't wait to visit the Villagio again-- they took me to the Middle Eastern restaurant in Villagio for dinner on my second visit day; and then we strolled around for a bit afterwards. The whole Venice motif rocked!	1

Its nothin to do with size n looks; it sure does with the money. Also I believe communication problem is there; usually u find the asians with good accent; I'm talkin as in majorities n minority. Also these white chicks are a bit expensive to keep. well but it is common. I had one before; infact i believe they are easier catch... well guys dont get me wrong here; but I'm tellin you this from my experience.	1

'Easier catch'; 'expensive to keep'; whew! I wish you could have been more subtle here... Nobody is a 'good catch'; buddy. If you find someone who reciprocates your feelings; the question of being expensive doesnt arise. Chances are; one wouldnt let the other bear everything on their own. Isnt that the basic principle of love? Care and share? Or have i lost it and become too old already?	1
why do you think you only see's asian girls with white guys and never asian guy with white girl? why asian girls go for white guys? is it becuase asian guy are too shy? or is it about size and height? or maybe you guys have answer to all my questions... i just wana know myself coz im not an asian girl?	and its so rare to see the other way around.	Hi iMz u talk as if u r a swinger dude western females are unreliable and secondly they are like that Use & throw sort of sh***t no Value ..... Thats why when it comes to an asian man he has a high value for a woman of any descent	1

OK - Qatari; I volunteer to start the group named "Stupid Stereotypes and Generalizations." So; instead of having these retarded posts every 3 days; we'll just have a group and everyone can go there and free up the board for more important things like cell phone ads and salary questions.	0

How many Asian guys do you see over here; sheer weight of numbers; I would think. Ok but my fiancee thinks its because the asian girls here are more westernised and therefore would have more in common with them. Also there are alot of Asian Girls dating Asian Guys here; perhaps you just don't see them; trust me she is Korean and would know the numbers. Perhaps you don't notice an Asian/Asian couple but notice an Asian white match more because it sticks in your brain. I have seen loads of Fillipino Couples out together; and I am told that Fillipino girls would much rather go out with Fillipino boys here as they have more in common and are not just trated as sex objects which we know many Arab guys do.	1

Is that likely to be he case and should go for a villa?	Coming to Qatar soon; and brining my dog (small Yorkie) fancy a nice apartment but unsure if the general rule in Doha will be NO Dogs allowed!! in apartments; even small dogs.	Same as back home - some yes; some no. Depends on the landlord.	1

Is it true that there's a penalty? How much per day?	My friend is already done in his medical and finger printing.His current sponsor is not yet processing his RP to be stamp in his passport.In his passport when he arrived here it says within seven days the bearer should process the RP.	I think u get a minimum of 28 days; before a fine is imposed.. but then again; it depends on visa to visa...!! Is it a valid RP visa ... or a visiting visa?	1

One should always be able to do what one wants to do; even if one is in a relationship. If it is a good relationship; one will not feel that there are uncomfortable restrictions. Being in a relationship should not mean one has to give up ones life or personality. If it feels that way; then maybe one is with the wrong partner.	0

I really want to know what is this Arabic fascination in almost all the British Curriculum schools in Doha? so what is the solution?	It is not compulsory in Indian schools.

Any advice out there?	Ok guys I am going to prehaps ticks someone off again but I have a question; not Sunny but me. Will a Qatari man go out with a western Christian girl; have sex with her and then move on because he think women from the west are wild and sex craved. Sunny has received quite a bit response from Qatari men who want to date her once we arrive; I even got an offer myself. But I believe it is a trap and I tell Sunny be careful.	It is a very rare Qatari man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in Qatar that wants anything more to do with a Western girl than you just described. Meeting men here is like stepping through a minefield. 9 out of 10 of them just want sex. And they will do and say anything to get it from you. I am not bitter; I do not hate men; but I have been living in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date. Asian opinion of Western women is not very high when it comes to sex and dating. Tell Sunny to stop advertising online for a date and come here and get the lay of the land first.	1

I must tell you redcajun504 Arab youths can go to any extent to get sex; but so is men from any country. Men have always sex on mind. It is always advisable to be cautious. But why are you worrying? There is a huge expat population here; which includes Indians; Europeans; Americans and even Australians. So; it's not a problem basically. Ask Sunny to be prudent and approach the things casually; without any pre-conceived notions; though caution is utmost required. You never know you may actually get a gem of person among these Arabians. After all; many of them have married Westerners. But dohagirl as such is correct that youths here always look for sex. On my own experience I must tell you they see Russians; Lebanese and Filipinos as someone always available for sex. Actually; this part of the world has many prostitutes from these communities; thronging star hotels. Use your common sense and things will be cozier for you. I wish you and your sister best of luck.

Life is not easy if you are a Western Woman; and the main reason a man from this part of the world would want a western woman is mainly for sex. However; please do not for one moment think that the men and women here con't have premarital relationships - they do it just not talked about and it is not caried out in the open. Due to the conservative background of the boys they will always return to their families and it would be vry difficult for them to marry outside the families would not be happy about it. I think it is much better to be very cautious out here although there are a great many handsome men and they can be very charming going through the Arab and Asian world of men they are all interested in SEX. One of the things is that being found to be together whoc ae not married can get into very deep trouble here - just a little food for thought.	1

Sadly this has been the case for many years. Maybe it originally stems from the days when arabs had loads of money; visited capital cities (mainly in the West) and were naturally surrounded (as they were rich) by hookers. Word spread when they returned that they had been with western women. The assumption would then be made that all Western women were loose. That is the assumption that we came to many years ago. Rather like the Western men going to Thailand	1

Thanks dweller..You have been fair.. DG..your point is sensible..I tried to see if the shoes fit on the other foot..and its same..Ironical?? (LOL...) It is a very rare Western man that would want anything more than what you just described. It is a very rare man in the West that wants anything more to do with a Asian girl than you just described. Its impossible to believe that the thousands of crippled shaking 70 year old Western men moving with 21 year old Asian beauties do so...because the guy was so romantic; loving and responsible that the girl fell head over heals in love with him.. I have seen Western men in various parts of Asia for the last 2 and a half years. Trust me when I say if you do not want to get burned be VERY careful who you date.

Why donÂ´t you date our friend here; Gineeshlee; he wants more than sex...or so it seems. Anyways; on a serious note. IÂ´ve seen too many fat red drunken western turists around here lately...and you know what; Qataries are much better behaved than that. At least they are rich and handsome; and donÂ´t get completely drunkenly smashed in public; so donÂ´t worry about dating them. Thing is; if you behave like a slut;all men will treat you like a slut. If you behave like a lady; chances are that you might find someone that treats you like a lady.	0

But they confirmed this to the newspaper. Any schools should set guidelines .. Even if a child gets a good sleep; it is normal for her to fall asleep in bus. Buses come as early as 6 a.m.	1

There was a similar case in Abudhabi last year I think......looks like this type of incident are not uncommon in this temperature. Schools need to be extra cautious with strict laws.	0

Really the school authorities need to be more responsible especially when they charge way too much in terms of special fee and all when compared to other schools in Doha. The facilities tey lack and the amount of negligence shown is too much. There is no conductor in most buses; even the ones in which small kids travel; and even after complaining to the school many times; there is no action. Many buses are hired and are driven by irresponsible drivers who dont care about anything. Another issue is the school building..which has been sooo long under planning and fund raising stage. What is the management of the school doing happily running their own businesses and draining all the money from the parents without giving anything back to the school.The school management should be held responsible for the extremely poor porta cabins in which they teach the junior wing and the lack of responsibility in issues r.....	1

GO to Hamad Woman Hospital in Hamad Medical Centre....if u have Hamad Health Card it would be an advantage; but if u dont all u can do just bring ur copy passport and married certificate (this one is required). it has very low cost for such a very good service of hospitality and doctors (obstetric & Gynecology). I was giving birth there 3 moths a go....very good hospital ;)....good luck	1
does anyone have any information on the cost i am going to encounter?	i am due to deliver soon; and my insurrance coverage does not cover delivery or anything related to maternity.	it depends on the Hospital; CS or normal; about 10;000 to 20;000 i think.	1

Go to Hamad Women's Hospital; bring all your necessary documents. My wife give birth there a couple of years ago. I only paid 200 QR for the room + around 35 QR for medicine and vitamins. Great service too.	1

In Hamad Hospital you will be best service in the world and they charge only 200 Riyal maximum that is room charges only. In Al-Ahli it will be about 15;000 to 20;000; (My friend's wife delivered there and they paid this amount)	1
However; I am surprised to find so many women not wearing them. Is there a need as long as I am dressed conservatively; or are those not wearing them being disrespectful and simply tolerated?

During my short visit I got the impression that Muslim or not; it's each individual's decision (or sometimes her family's or community's decision) and if no veil is chosen (whether for the hair alone/hijab or hair and face/burka/niqab) that modest dress is ok.	1

Hi; if you are to work in Ras Laffan; do you live there; too? Are there housing accomodations in the RL industrial area? Is this true? So if you live in Ras Laffan; what is the entertainment like there?	If I look at a map; the drive between Ras Laffan and Doha looks to be 60+ minutes.	Depends on the company you're working for. They will have their own camps within RLIC; with their own entertainment and it's up to them who lives there and who commutes from Doha. It's about an hour and a quarter bus journey from Doha.	1

Are there some simple restaurants to go to if you don't want to cook dinner at night? Or; are there cafes to walk to just to relax? I'm not interested in any heavy disco scenes .

I've worked in oil camps before so I know what you mean about adjusting to the life. In other words; there is no way to take a bus or taxi to any small town that is nearby - like Al Khor - just to get away from the work site for a few hours? Sometimes it's good to get into a different scene for a while. Is there taxi service outside Las Raffan?	0

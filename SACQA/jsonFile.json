#1 for paris if you are in paris driving a car be aware that people in paris drive however they want to tip #2 if you have a car get a good tourist book which will tell you where and where not to park tip #3 learn a bit of french a great book which has a lot of basic phrases and fun things to try is rick steves handy pocketbook guide to basic french find book tip #4 use the metro the subway there is simply no better way to get around paris but make sure you ve brushed up on your french it will help with buying tickets and understanding the maps in the subways tip #5 the lines and crowds at the eiffel tower can get very long if you must see the lights of paris at night and you should go on a week night not friday or make reservations tip #6 the louvre from what i understand if you are an art lover and really appreciate art museums you could spend weeks there but for most people half a day is enough time you see the famous pictures mona lisa and spend some time looking at the amazing art if you go on sunday morning and get there as they re opening it s free admission tip # 7 if there is one place that is absolutely crazy to drive in paris it s in the roundabout that goes around the arc d triomphe if you rent a car and drive here just go travelling around in your car like you would if there were no rules tip #8 there are lots of wonderful museums in france one of them is the pantheon which was originally a church and originally planned to be something other than that victor hugo and some other famous french people are buried there make sure you set aside some time and some money to visit the museums if that s something you want to do tip #9 have some small change or large change if you can afford it on hand for the street performers they re pretty good tip #10 if you like looking at the inside of churches take some time for notre dame and if you have a problem with crowds don t go on the weekend people were pretty respectful inside the cathedral on the weekdays but there are a lot of people there on the weekends so you end up waiting in line and it gets more noisy inside tip #11 if you want to see the eiffel tower light up and sparkle at night get
